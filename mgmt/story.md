# Storytelling to influence
* 30 - 90 sec stories, better many short ones than a long one
* one story, multiple meanings. same story to reinforce multiple points
* dont' start with "let me tell a story", use transiction phrase
* Ease in
  * by the way
  * this reminds of a time
  * you know, this is life
* Ease out
  * back to the point
  * where were we?
* add details to enrich story to > 30s

# How to tell story with data

* Human is geared to understand stories rather than data.
* stages of stories
### Exposition
    * Why are data important for the audience
### Rising action/Conflict 
    * build excitement
    * generate conflict
       * two view points
       * one viewpoint with uncertainty
### climax 
    * key findings
    * how can the data can resolve the conflict
    * inconclusive data is okey - leaves suspecsion
       * Storiy isn't over
       * let your audience exicted for the resolution in the future and sequel

### falling action 
    * details, context, intepretation
### resolution 
    * key results, importance, action


### Guide the audience through the plot 
* big pictures first, details appropirates
* broad stroks, large scale landscape first
  * Reminder on the key hypothesis, main purpose of the data point
  * most important piece of message, "up means better"
  * covers other conditions later, go into more details later

### Make the audience care about the data
* curiosity even though not revelant
* related to each person's personal interest
* data is the story, not your perosnal story

* pausing w/o answers will help grab audience's attention
* start with the main message to takeaway and then work backwards, remind yourself of it all the time
  * e.g., back to the conflict, and the first 2 stages of the story telling 
* capture the attention by the story of one person - people would like to connect with them. But don't solely rely on them because they are misleading

### build suspense but not surpise 
* audience see the bomb, but not characters
* tell auidence what they are about to learn but not yet
* build suspense around the problem through conflict, and then use data to resolve the conflict

   


### audience vertial or horizontal?

* ask audience to participate in the middle of the presentation is a high risk/high reward
* helps build conflict in the rising audience stage
* better for informal settings
* Humor is super high risk






30-90 secs for a short story
 
As storytellers, many shy away from touching conflict. This is a mistake, as conflict or hardship can be a powerful thing if embraced. You can use it to draw an audience in, and it also makes a happy ending even more uplifting. We shouldn’t gloss over the hard truths as we communicate, as that is what connects us to others. Human connection is the goal when telling any story.

We were always required to find the story behind the story. The story wasn’t the hurricane; it was the person who rescued the dog in the middle of the flood. The story wasn’t the Super Bowl; it was the guy who spent all day lining the field or sewing the football. Look for the story behind the story.

Whatever you’d like to get across to your audience needs to provoke some kind of emotional reaction. Otherwise, it won’t get too far. Analyze what emotional hook your story has, find the heroes in the story and create a piece worth reading or watching, even if it’s an ad for a “boring” service or product.

Listen and focus on solutions to customers’ unique problems. Too often, storytelling becomes only about marketing the brand with stories that are layered in too much “features and benefits” rhetoric. Taking a marketing hat off and putting a customer service or sales hat on can help you tell stories that better articulate the actual concerns of current customers as well as future ones.

For instance, if your target group is opinionated, the typical currency is charm. If your target group are thinkers, the currency is logic and numbers to make a point. For target groups that are meant to be inspired, try testing different images—images with one person versus images with a family, for instance—to accompany your story

Every storytelling exercise should begin by asking: Who is my audience and what is the message I want to share with them? Each decision about your story should flow from those questions. Sachs says that leaders should ask, “What is the core moral that I’m trying to implant in my team?” and “How can I boil that down to a compelling single statement?” For instance, if your team is behaving as if failure is not an option, you might decide to impart the message that failure is actually the grandfather of success. Or if you are trying to convince senior leaders to take a risk by supporting your project, you could convey that most companies are built on taking smart chances.

You can be a central figure, but the ultimate focus should be on people you know, lessons you’ve learned, or events you’ve witnessed. And whenever possible, you should endeavor to “make the audience or employees the hero,” says Morgan. It increases their engagement and willingness to buy in to your message. “One of the main reasons we listen to stories is to create a deeper belief in ourselves,” says Sachs. “But when the storyteller talks about how great they are, the audience shuts down.” The more you celebrate your own decisions, the less likely your audience will connect with you and your message.

. “Good storytellers understand that a story needs conflict,” says Morgan. Is there a competitor that needs to be bested? A market challenge that needs to be overcome? A change-resistant industry that needs to be transformed? Don’t be afraid to suggest the road ahead will be difficult. “We actually like to be told it’s going to be hard,” says Morgan. “Smart leaders tell employees, ‘This is going to be tough. But if we all pull together and hang in there, we’ll achieve something amazing in the end.’” A well-crafted story embedded with that kind of a rallying cry means “you don’t have to demand change or effort,” says Sachs. “People will become your partners in change,” because they want to be part of the journey.

 Don’t let needless details to detract from your core message. Work from the principle that “less is more.” One of the biggest mistakes you can make is “putting in too much detail of the wrong kind,” says Morgan. Don’t tell your audience what day of the week it was, for instance, or what shoes you were wearing if it doesn’t advance the story in an artful way. But transporting your audience with a few interesting, well-placed details — how you felt, the expression on a face, the humble beginnings of a now-great company — can help immerse your listeners and drive home your message.

But stories create “sticky” memories by attaching emotions to things that happen.

One great way to do so is to create suspense which attracts audiences with unanswered questions and an interest to learn more and answer those questions. Surprising your audience is also a great way to pull readers in.

Another way is to “Show, don’t tell,” where you captivate with details that bring your story to life.

For example, say your company is launching a new product. You can share details about when your team came up with the idea, which is more exciting than telling customers you’re about to release the best new product. Talk about the roadblocks and small wins; make your audience feel part of your process.

Every story features at least one character, and this character is key to relating your audience back to the story. The main character is the protagonist.

Your characters form the bridge between you, the storyteller, and the audience. If your audience can put themselves in your character’s shoes, they’ll be more likely to follow through with your call-to-action.

Conflict in your story elicits emotions and connects the audience through relatable experiences. When telling stories, the power is in what you convey and teach. If there’s no conflict in your story, it’s likely not a story.

Every good story has a closing. Your resolution should wrap up the story, give context to the characters and conflict(s), and leave your audience with a call to action.

Incite Action
Your story should describe how you completed a successful action in the past and explain how readers might be able to create the same kind of change. Avoid excessive, exaggerated detail or changes in the subject so your audience can focus on the action or change that your story encourages.

Tell Your Story
Talk about your genuine, humanizing struggles, failures, and wins. Today’s consumer appreciates and connects to brands that market with authenticity. Your storytelling should reflect your authentic self.


Convey Values
Tell stories that tap into familiar emotions, characters, and situations so readers can understand how it applies to their lives.

Also, tell stories that convey your brand values, like causes you support and care for, whether directly or indirectly related to your brand. For example, you can share a case study about the impact of a fundraiser you created or explain the environmentally-conscious production process for your products.

It’s an essential type of story to tell, as consumers care more than ever about what the brands they buy from stand for and whether their values align. They want to know about the causes you support and your commitments to bettering the world.

Foster Community or Collaboration
Tell stories that move readers to discuss and share stories with others, stories where people might say, “Hey, me too.” Stories that foster this kind of community building inspire audiences to continue to come back to your business and develop connections with you and other people that are also impacted.


Your objective and call-to-action (CTA) are similar, but your CTA will establish the action you’d like your audience to take after reading.

What exactly do you want your readers to do after reading? Do you want them to donate money, subscribe to a newsletter, take a course, or buy a product? Outline this alongside your objective to make sure they line up.

For example, if your objective is to foster community or collaboration, your CTA might be to "Tap the share button below."
