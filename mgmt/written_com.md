Good paragraphs answer the following three questions:
* What are you trying to tell your reader?
* Why is it important for the reader to know this?
* How should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?
  * The garp() function returns the delta between a dataset's mean and median. Many people believe unquestioningly that a mean always holds the truth. However, a mean is easily influenced by a few very large or very small data points. Call garp() to help determine whether a few very large or very small data points are influencing the mean too much. A relatively small garp() value suggests that the mean is more meaningful than when the garp() value is relatively high.


good documentation = knowledge and skills your audience needs to do a task − your audience's current knowledge and skills

In the United States, reserve which for nonessential subordinate clauses, and use that for an essential subordinate clause that the sentence can't live without

Bash is a modern shell scripting language that takes many of its features from KornShell 88, which was developed at Bell Labs. The first subordinate clause extends the main idea, but the second subordinate clause goes in another direction. Divide this sentence in two.

Lisp is a programming language that relies on Polish prefix notation, which is one of the systems invented by the Polish logician Jan Łukasiewicz. The first subordinate clause is clearly critical to the sentence, but the second subordinate clause takes the reader too far away from the main clause. Divide this sentence in two.

I don't want to say that Fortran is old, but only radiocarbon dating can determine its true age. The subordinate clause is critical to the sentence, so this sentence is fine as is.


There are risks in both pedagogies. In the first way a sche­ matic structure that we then modify and qualify we risk ap- pearing to be superficial before we have a chance to qualify and elaborate. We also risk the possibility that the learner will learn only the simple structure and then caricature it. But the second way   teaching a structure of knowledge by simultaneously de­ scribing, qualifying, elaborating, complicating every detail­ risks conceptual clutter

When presenting complex new knowledge, first sketch a schematic structure that is too simple to reflect the complex reality of the subject; only then qualify, elaborate, and modify it. We have found that it is not effective to present new knowledge about language and style as a series of detailed, qualified, exception-laden observations. 

If you think it is clear, revise it by reversing the principles and make the passage worse. Nothing highlights what counts as clear and di­ rect better than seeing it in contrast with what is not.


“A scrupulous writer”, observed Orwell, “in every sentence that he writes will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is
this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?”

One-sentence paragraphs should be used only occasionally.

If too many sentences begin Compare, Consider, Expect, Imagine, Look at, Note, Prepare for, Remember or Take, readers will think they are reading a textbook (or, indeed, a style book). This may not be the way to persuade them to renew their subscriptions.

don’t boast of your own cleverness by telling readers that you correctly predicted something or that you have a scoop. You are more likely to bore or irritate them than to impress them.

Nobody needs to be described as silly: let your analysis show that he is. When you express opinions, do not simply make assertions. The aim is not just
to tell readers what you think, but to persuade them; if you use arguments, reasoning and evidence, you may succeed. Go easy on the oughts and shoulds.

If the article is a report, the facts must be selected and presented as a story. If it is a leader or more analytical article, it should also have a sense of sequence, so that the reader feels he is progressing from a beginning to a conclusion.

In starting your article, let your model be the essays of Francis Bacon. He starts “Of Riches” with “I cannot call riches better than the baggage of virtue.” “Of cunning” opens with “We take cunning for a sinister or crooked wisdom.” “Of Suspicion” is instantly on the wing with “Suspicions amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds, they ever fly by twilight.” Each of these beginnings carries implicitly within it an entire essay. Each seizes the reader by the lapels and at once draws him into the subject.

Catch the attention of the reader and then get straight into the article. do not spend several sentences clearing your throat, setting the scene or sketching in the background. 

slow down -> dont' understand -> aggreviated -> stop

Controlling the sequence in which you present your ideas is the single most important act necessary to clear writing. The clearest sequence is always to give the summarizing idea before you give the individual ideas being summarized. I cannot emphasize this point too much.

Minto’s Pyramid Principle from the aforementioned book. Start by brainstorming your proposal into a series of arguments that support your answer. Once you’ve written them all down, group them into related arguments. Shape those groups into three top-level arguments, with up to three sub-arguments supporting each of those top-level arguments. Recursively apply this approach, ensuring each argument summarizes its at-most-three sub-arguments. Order the arguments within each group by descending importance. At that point, you’re done.

Creative work is best done in short chunks with breaks. For example, you could write as rapidly as possible for 30 minutes, using short sentences and informal language. Take a 5 minute break, and then write about another idea.
Set a deadline for when your madman will hand off his duties to the architect. At some point your ideas will need structure and strategy

When producing, use the content generated from your brainstorming, researching, and freewriting. Insert that “raw material” into the outline. If you’re not sure what to do with a sentence, put it aside for the judge to decide.
As with the madman, time your carpenter’s work. The goal is to write as rapidly as possible. If you review each sentence too carefully for grammar, punctuation, etc., you’ll slow down the building and probably feel blocked.

* Can you write the same thing but with fewer and/or shorter words? Is the whole piece too long or too short? Is your average sentence length between 15 and 20 words?
* Does it pass the 20 second (or 2 second) test and grab your reader’s attention?
* Have you read your work aloud to check for errors and improvements?



# Five paragraph order
* "S" Situation, "M" Mission, "E" Execution, "A" Administration/Logistics, "C" Command/Signal.
* Execution – If a briefing is considered to be a sandwich this would be considered the filling. It should be the longest part of the briefing and will explain in detail exactly what is going to be done under all conditions. This means the first plan of attack and any thing that will be done if the plan is compromised in any way for example if something unexpected happens.
* Command and signal – This section involves mainly two things everything to do with radios and all passwords and code names and signals which may be used during the patrol.


### On Slides

One thing to avoid—slides with a lot of text, especially if it’s a repeat of what you’re saying out loud. It’s like if you give a paper handout in a meeting—everyone’s head goes down and they read, rather than staying heads-up and listening. If there are a lot of words on your slide, you’re asking your audience to split their attention between what they’re reading and what they’re hearing. That’s really hard for a brain to do, and it compromises the effectiveness of both your slide text and your spoken words. If you can’t avoid having text-y slides, try to progressively reveal text (like unveiling bullet points one by one) as you need it.
.

Have no more than six lines of text per slide.

The 7 x 7 rule states that no slide should contain more than 7 lines of text and 7 words per line. The recommended word limit total varies widely from 6 to 40 words per slide.

 Your slides should serve as an outline that highlights the key points to make

  Eliminate orphans to help maximize font size, reduce the total number of words per slide, and create a professional look.  Eliminating orphans is as easy as rewording the bullet-point, resizing the text box, or resizing the font.

Something that can be read is documentation (regardless of which software application you’re using), not presentation (which is an audio – and sometimes visual – communication). You can’t optimize for both at the same time, and trying to do both in one PowerPoint deck just means you’re sub-optimal at both documentation and presentation.

dont directly continue from the first slide

Go for one, poignant textual point per slide, and one high-quality image.

put space between bulletin points

Too many slides = death. Cut content. Be ruthless. Each slide should last for 1.5 mins

intro-background-solution-result: 3:3:5:5

Slide titles are prime real estate: Use slide content to prove your point(may need multiple slides though)

Claims 15 in slide titles => strong story line

Use log log‐scale: ‐ when range spans 2+

orders of magnitude ‐ to highlight ratios instead of difference
