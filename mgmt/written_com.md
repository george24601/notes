### course 3
Think hard about the goal/what you want from your writing, have an outcome objective and work backwards.

There is always more you could say, cut them down to what you should say, and finally to what you must say just to one message. one acts as a foundation for another

Give them what they need add them. Moving the background and context to the end.

avg 15-20 words per sentence

add a newline between paragraphs
paragraph: 1 topic sentenct + 2-4 other sentences

aside from logos, 
pathos - use emotional one. 
 * Show passion
 * metaphor
 * Show stories - why should the reader care. Best story is personal
ethos-credibility, different from showing off
quote is a way to borrow credibility

be direct: active voice, verbs, and take responsbility active responsbility unaccoutable is bad for building trust, difficult but increases credibility
use passive you want to move on and don't want to point fingers
focus on the receiver

turn noun into verb. Please submit your application - please apply
ion, ment, ing, ance

here is the report for approval - please approve this report

peronsal connection - not as systems, focus on the impact on the readers. Work hard to ground the reality. What would actually mean the reader? Take about people, given reader a picture what is happening 

Acronym is a symptom of the curse of knowledge.
Of course, as you seen, you will have seen, sign of making massive assumptions

management cliche: think outside the box, low hanging fruit...

better clear rather than brief

in email grab attention by strong subject line: ACTION by Friday 1pm: healthcare speech
READ ALOUD - have ear plug may help reduce embarassment

good writings come from editing and rewriting.Writing block is the fear of writing it bad. Embrace it 







### course 2
3 common types of business messages
informative: Tell readers about a new initiaitve, procedure, or operation, 
* Complete the thought "As a result of this message, I want my audience to know X "
negative, persuative

Informative:
opening: clearly tell the audience what you want them to know
Reasons: drive the point you are tyring to make, offer benefits to readers if applicable
positive close: remind your audience of what you want them to know. Possible add contact info. Short and related to the topic

Persuasive:
Opening: clearly tell the audience what you want them to do
* state the problem/oppurtunity, and tell the audience what you want to do with it
* get readers attention quickly and make them see the issue from your pov
* They must view the situtaion less than ideal if persuation is ever going to work
Reasons: antificapting readers'q estuions and answer them with facts and emotional appeals
* Fact is only 50% of persuation. Emotional appeals - use anecdotes when possible
Action steps: remind your audicne of waht you want them to do, this seciton turns ideas into action
* Limit the possible areas of confusion

Show the bleak reality and show them what it could be if they follow your advice
Continously contrasting is necessary

use of jargon depends on context. may also improve credibility. Avoid industry-specific terminology, e.g., acronym, even 90% certainty means don't use it




### course 1

* 3 main purposes: inform, persuade, show good will
* 25% planning, 25% producing, 50% polishing. Note it is not linear, waterfall
* Polishing: Think, revise (on the global issues, 45% of time), proofreading (5%, local issues). Works backwords from deadline
* More expectation with written communication

* Starting with body, because beginning and end of the message are the hardest. Quantity over quality
* Devise a strategy.
 * Positive or neutral. Start with headline. Add reasons and details. Pleasant close
 * Negative unexpected. Buffer + reason + pleasant
 * Work from an outline. Divide main idea to 3-5 sections

Smoothing over conflicts is for face-to-face. Harder to say no when in face to face. Email is the lowest cue so harder for reader to digest

save long, complex, or sensitive messages for other channels

avoid empty or dangerous words. That will put people off. Summarize the purpose of the email,e.g., including key deadlines, [action required] is ok. Ok to label the most important issues. Expand immediately after the subject line. AIs in simple sentences. 

Mirroring: reflect your audience preference of communication

evidence: 
* credibility
  * What you feel creditible may not be so to others
  * What my reputation? How much people know me?
  * How much background information we need
  * credentials we could use
  * Speaking the language we use
* logic
  * aside from data, stats, use metaphors and comparable examples
* emotion 
  * Stories is order of magnitude more effective than facts

So what?
* Use tension Show the audience where they could be now and where they could be - a user story
* Justify solution. 
* Frame your proposal with "you view" From the audience with the you view "You will get this if we do that" instead of "I need this because..."

Reader's attention is valuable and finite. Attention getter at the beginning + audience remembers las

AIDA framework
* Attention: grab the reader's attion with something unexpected and catchy in a positive way. Offer startling stats and numbers. "see how much time was wasted on the old process"
* Interest: a list to highlight the benefits
* desire: anticipate the friction. can pre-emptive address thme
* action: what steps we need to take. Exactly, need a sense of urgency

Concise
* remove the redundancies: 
repeat yourself without a strategic purpose. 
Same sentence and words multiple times in the paragraph
1-pager doesn't need intro or conclusion.
* Unbury words
* delete the obvious. "My name is", "just", "i am writing to tell you that"


Use precise working. No hedging or exucerance: think, feel, believe, sort of, extremely, absolutely
Reuse buried verb. obvious phrases.

8 lines or less or each paragraph
cut out filler. Phrase to fillers
Remove empty content: to the degree that, in the case of, in nature, of the fact that

Focus each paragraph on 1 main idea, can be only 1 line












### On Slides

One thing to avoid—slides with a lot of text, especially if it’s a repeat of what you’re saying out loud. It’s like if you give a paper handout in a meeting—everyone’s head goes down and they read, rather than staying heads-up and listening. If there are a lot of words on your slide, you’re asking your audience to split their attention between what they’re reading and what they’re hearing. That’s really hard for a brain to do, and it compromises the effectiveness of both your slide text and your spoken words. If you can’t avoid having text-y slides, try to progressively reveal text (like unveiling bullet points one by one) as you need it.
.

Have no more than six lines of text per slide.

The 7 x 7 rule states that no slide should contain more than 7 lines of text and 7 words per line. The recommended word limit total varies widely from 6 to 40 words per slide.

 Your slides should serve as an outline that highlights the key points to make

  Eliminate orphans to help maximize font size, reduce the total number of words per slide, and create a professional look.  Eliminating orphans is as easy as rewording the bullet-point, resizing the text box, or resizing the font.

Something that can be read is documentation (regardless of which software application you’re using), not presentation (which is an audio – and sometimes visual – communication). You can’t optimize for both at the same time, and trying to do both in one PowerPoint deck just means you’re sub-optimal at both documentation and presentation.

dont directly continue from the first slide

Go for one, poignant textual point per slide, and one high-quality image.

put space between bulletin points

Too many slides = death. Cut content. Be ruthless. Each slide should last for 1.5 mins

intro-background-solution-result: 3:3:5:5

Slide titles are prime real estate: Use slide content to prove your point(may need multiple slides though)

Claims 15 in slide titles => strong story line

Use log log‐scale: ‐ when range spans 2+

orders of magnitude ‐ to highlight ratios instead of difference
