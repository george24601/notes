### reduce filler

We use these words as a verbal place holder when we are thinking — while communicating. They are a verbal representation of our thinking and an indication to our listener that we are not yet done communicating. They are a signal that what we are saying is getting ahead of what we are thinking.

Additionally, practicing your speech will definitively reduce your use of filler words. When we are prepared for any communications scenario we are more focused and effective in our deliver. 

A better habit than abuse/overuse of filler words is to allow yourself to pause. Doing so will allow you to think about what you will say next without filling the space with words that don’t serve your communication. Pause, then construct what you are going to say internally before you open your mouth.

A pause of silence allows us to think of what we’ll say next, stay centered and focused on the accuracy and effectiveness of our communication.

Speaking at a less hurried pace alongside these other techniques will help minimize your use of these meaningless words. 

. With any important speech you should practice and record it at least 3-5 times. After each attempt, review your recording and count how often you used filler words. Note the number of filler words and then run through your speech again with an effort to relax, center yourself, and use pauses or words that serve your communication instead. Remember to slow down and be mindful of your word choice

As you listen to your recorded sessions (audio or video) take note of what filler words you use and their frequency. Knowing your habits is a first step in a rising self-awareness that will bring freedom from these poor habits.

Using filler words is a sign of nervousness and lack of preparation. Audiences are connected to confident speakers, and crutch words may detract from an otherwise excellent speech.

In order to start the process of elimination, you must become aware of your favorite filler words,” Smith says. “Personally, my go-to word was ‘so.’ Once I became aware of that, I realized my pattern of usage. Moving forward, during presentations I would mentally catch myself about to say 'so' and pause to avoid verbalizing it

Forcing yourself to notice other people’s less-than-eloquent speech patterns, too, can make you conscious of how often you slip “like” into daily conversations, say “um” before answering questions at cocktail parties, or lead sentences with an unnecessary “so” during work presentations.

While you can’t really prep canned answers for life’s impromptu conversations, knowing which situations exacerbate your verbal crutch dependency is a good place to start. This way, for example, you can head into that cocktail party or pitch meeting with some foresight, ready to catch yourself before “so” and “um” sneak out too often.

If you’re a person who likes to write out what you plan to say, be sure to eliminate compound sentences, never start with a prepositional phrase, put most of your sentences in subject/predicate order and eliminate any vocabulary that you have difficulty saying without hesitating. The basic idea is to write for the ear, not the eye!

the optimum frequency is about one filler per minute, but the average speaker uses five fillers per minute — or, one every twelve seconds.

As long as the pause isn’t too long (no more than five seconds), the audience won’t hold it against you

 On average, the optimal ratio of preparation to performance is one hour of practice for every minute of presentation, but at the very least

, recommends speakers get in at least three full runs before stepping in front of an audience.




### Wallenda factor
If you spent time observing the behavior and actions of others, at
most you can make an educated guess about their attitude. As a
supervisor, you will assess employee performance and make
judgments on employee behavior and actions, but not attitude. Yet, a
person’s attitude is what directly influences his or her approach to
work. 

Behavior is reflected in one’s actions.
• Attitude represents one’s feelings or emotions toward something.
• Beliefs are the convictions and underlying truths one holds.

 beliefs influence attitude which affects behavior. What we notice in the behaviors of others
will reinforce or challenge their underlying belief structure and attitude.

Self regard is an intrinsic judgment, while the “Wallenda Factor” is an extrinsic judgment about producing an
outcome.  The Wallenda Factor relates to one’s perception of the
outcome of an event.

 ‘All karl thought about for three straight months prior to it was falling. It was the first
time he’d ever thought about that, and it seemed to me that he put all his energies into not falling rather than walking the tightrope

When his team dropped its first
game after 29 straight home court victories, we called to see how he felt about it. His response
was vintage Wallenda: ‘Great! Now I can start concentrating on winning, not on not losing.’
Meyer helped frame for us what we’re now referring to as the Wallenda factor, the capacity to
embrace positive goals, to pour one’s energies into the task, not into looking behind and
dredging up excuses for past events.

That is, as organizations strive to
accomplish challenging outcomes, there will be setbacks. When the mindset is that of learning and not
failing, then the learning helps drive people to produce the set of intended outcomes

Build self-confidence through
high expectations. Successful
leaders have high expectations,
both of themselves and of their
consituents.

the expectation that an
employee can perform at a level that he/she does not
see himself/herself capable of achieving. Creates a shift
in the individual’s confidence that he/she can perform at
the higher level—and then does so.

Before you can achieve the kind of life you want, you must think, act, talk, and conduct
yourself in all of your affairs as would the person you wish to become. Attitude is not the
result of success; success is the result of positive attitudes.

Fear of failure makes you focus on limiting risks instead of focusing on maximizing an opportunity for success


### Personal vision

Career aspirations are not the same as career goals. A goal is usually a more specific, short-term objective with a detailed plan for achieving it.

The difference between the two is subtle but important. 
* A goal usually has a set time frame in which to achieve it. The time required to achieve an aspiration is variable.
* While a goal focuses on achieving a specific, tangible outcome, an aspiration is more general. Aspirations also leave room for different outcomes and results.
* Demonstrate that your aspirations align with the company’s vision and long-term goals
Show the interviewer how the role will help you gain the skills and experience necessary to achieve your career aspirations

The vision statement should typically communicate your goal in 30 to 40 words. 

* Identify your strengths
View your skills as ways to make improvements in your future role. When it comes to using your statement to advance your career, approach the job market with positivity and confidence in order to convince potential employers that you are the best candidate for the job.
* Reflect on your values 
Is it important that your work gives back to society?
Do you prioritize work-life balance?
Are you motivated by inspiring others?
Do you believe in taking responsibility for your own actions?
* Evaluate how your skills can solve real-world issues
 * What issues are you passionate about?
 * Are there issues that your personal strengths are particularly well-suited to tackling?
 * Are there certain issues, like human rights or financial regulation, that fit well with your core values?
* Your aim should be to keep the statement concise while giving enough detail to make it unique. The statement can be written in two sentences, which helps keep it brief and to the point. Here is a sentence-by-sentence breakdown to make the most of this short, concise statement:
 * First sentence: Simply state the field you want to work in or the specific job you want to have. For instance, you may write that you want to be an insurance broker for a large insurer or a mechanical engineer at a top company.
 * Second sentence. Explain your reason for setting the career goal in your first sentence. Perhaps you want to make improvements to how insurance policies are sold to young people or develop new technology for the oil sector.
* Include your vision statement in your resume. The best place to add your career vision statement is to your objectives section. This placement gives potential employers a clear idea of how your previous education and work experience translates into your ambitions for the future.



### Self development

When an employee has a chance to reflect on (and select) their own development goals, instead of being given goals, they’re more likely to be intrinsically motivated to improve. 
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors have I developed over the last [time frame] that enabled me to be successful?
  * Consider how it has made you successful and give specific examples.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors would have helped me better achieve my goals over the last [time frame]?
  * Consider goals that you have not achieved yet and goals you could have achieved easier or faster.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I wish I had developed over the last [time frame] but were not able to yet?
  * Have you set yourself a development goal that you haven’t achieved yet but still would like to?

  * Are these obstacles a skill or knowledge deficit or are they something that is outside of your control?
* What would be the impact of reaching my goals on? The business and my career
* Remembering my strengths, what are the 1-2 next steps I will take to achieve my development goals?
 * For example, any L&D resources, or experts, you can take advantage of? Bonus points for writing as “if x happens, I will do y”. Commit to a date by when you will have accomplished this.

### Brag doc

I think it’s okay to make it quite long / comprehensive – 5-10 pages or more for a year of work doesn’t seem like too much to me, especially if you’re including some graphs/charts / screenshots to show the effects of what you did.

* Goals for this year and Goals for next year
* Projects: For each one, list contribution and impact. Impact may need to comeback and fill later
* Collaboration & mentorship
* Design & documentation: List design docs & documentation that you worked on
* Company building: “things you did to help the company overall, not just your project / team”
* What you learned: try listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently



###icebox
Request in 2018, but got rejected in 2019-09:
As a scrum master, I would like an icebox feature so that when I am planning, I have place to put issues on hold for now, but but still keep them in sight.  
We have the sprint above the backlog.  We would like the icebox below the backlog.  I could do the same by creating a sprint called "icebox" but it appears above the backlog.  Instead, it should be below the backlog.  

Either create a status called icebox and allow transition from to do, OR (do what I do) and create a sprint called icebox.
