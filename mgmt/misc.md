### reduce filler

We use these words as a verbal place holder when we are thinking — while communicating. They are a verbal representation of our thinking and an indication to our listener that we are not yet done communicating. They are a signal that what we are saying is getting ahead of what we are thinking.

Additionally, practicing your speech will definitively reduce your use of filler words. When we are prepared for any communications scenario we are more focused and effective in our deliver. 

A better habit than abuse/overuse of filler words is to allow yourself to pause. Doing so will allow you to think about what you will say next without filling the space with words that don’t serve your communication. Pause, then construct what you are going to say internally before you open your mouth.

A pause of silence allows us to think of what we’ll say next, stay centered and focused on the accuracy and effectiveness of our communication.

Speaking at a less hurried pace alongside these other techniques will help minimize your use of these meaningless words. 

. With any important speech you should practice and record it at least 3-5 times. After each attempt, review your recording and count how often you used filler words. Note the number of filler words and then run through your speech again with an effort to relax, center yourself, and use pauses or words that serve your communication instead. Remember to slow down and be mindful of your word choice

As you listen to your recorded sessions (audio or video) take note of what filler words you use and their frequency. Knowing your habits is a first step in a rising self-awareness that will bring freedom from these poor habits.

Using filler words is a sign of nervousness and lack of preparation. Audiences are connected to confident speakers, and crutch words may detract from an otherwise excellent speech.

In order to start the process of elimination, you must become aware of your favorite filler words,” Smith says. “Personally, my go-to word was ‘so.’ Once I became aware of that, I realized my pattern of usage. Moving forward, during presentations I would mentally catch myself about to say 'so' and pause to avoid verbalizing it

Forcing yourself to notice other people’s less-than-eloquent speech patterns, too, can make you conscious of how often you slip “like” into daily conversations, say “um” before answering questions at cocktail parties, or lead sentences with an unnecessary “so” during work presentations.

While you can’t really prep canned answers for life’s impromptu conversations, knowing which situations exacerbate your verbal crutch dependency is a good place to start. This way, for example, you can head into that cocktail party or pitch meeting with some foresight, ready to catch yourself before “so” and “um” sneak out too often.

If you’re a person who likes to write out what you plan to say, be sure to eliminate compound sentences, never start with a prepositional phrase, put most of your sentences in subject/predicate order and eliminate any vocabulary that you have difficulty saying without hesitating. The basic idea is to write for the ear, not the eye!

the optimum frequency is about one filler per minute, but the average speaker uses five fillers per minute — or, one every twelve seconds.

As long as the pause isn’t too long (no more than five seconds), the audience won’t hold it against you

 On average, the optimal ratio of preparation to performance is one hour of practice for every minute of presentation, but at the very least

, recommends speakers get in at least three full runs before stepping in front of an audience.


### Wallenda factor

 beliefs influence attitude which affects behavior. What we notice in the behaviors of others
will reinforce or challenge their underlying belief structure and attitude.

Self regard is an intrinsic judgment, while the “Wallenda Factor” is an extrinsic judgment about producing an
outcome.  The Wallenda Factor relates to one’s perception of the
outcome of an event.

 ‘All karl thought about for three straight months prior to it was falling. It was the first
time he’d ever thought about that, and it seemed to me that he put all his energies into not falling rather than walking the tightrope

When his team dropped its first
game after 29 straight home court victories, we called to see how he felt about it. His response
was vintage Wallenda: ‘Great! Now I can start concentrating on winning, not on not losing.’
Meyer helped frame for us what we’re now referring to as the Wallenda factor, the capacity to
embrace positive goals, to pour one’s energies into the task, not into looking behind and
dredging up excuses for past events.

That is, as organizations strive to
accomplish challenging outcomes, there will be setbacks. When the mindset is that of learning and not
failing, then the learning helps drive people to produce the set of intended outcomes

Build self-confidence through
high expectations. Successful
leaders have high expectations,
both of themselves and of their
consituents.

the expectation that an
employee can perform at a level that he/she does not
see himself/herself capable of achieving. Creates a shift
in the individual’s confidence that he/she can perform at
the higher level—and then does so.

Before you can achieve the kind of life you want, you must think, act, talk, and conduct
yourself in all of your affairs as would the person you wish to become. Attitude is not the
result of success; success is the result of positive attitudes.

Fear of failure makes you focus on limiting risks instead of focusing on maximizing an opportunity for success
