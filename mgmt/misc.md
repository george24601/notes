### Personal vision

Career aspirations are not the same as career goals. A goal is usually a more specific, short-term objective with a detailed plan for achieving it.

The difference between the two is subtle but important. 
* A goal usually has a set time frame in which to achieve it. The time required to achieve an aspiration is variable.
* While a goal focuses on achieving a specific, tangible outcome, an aspiration is more general. Aspirations also leave room for different outcomes and results.
* Demonstrate that your aspirations align with the company’s vision and long-term goals
Show the interviewer how the role will help you gain the skills and experience necessary to achieve your career aspirations

The vision statement should typically communicate your goal in 30 to 40 words. 

* Identify your strengths
View your skills as ways to make improvements in your future role. When it comes to using your statement to advance your career, approach the job market with positivity and confidence in order to convince potential employers that you are the best candidate for the job.
* Reflect on your values 
Is it important that your work gives back to society?
Do you prioritize work-life balance?
Are you motivated by inspiring others?
Do you believe in taking responsibility for your own actions?
* Evaluate how your skills can solve real-world issues
 * What issues are you passionate about?
 * Are there issues that your personal strengths are particularly well-suited to tackling?
 * Are there certain issues, like human rights or financial regulation, that fit well with your core values?
* Your aim should be to keep the statement concise while giving enough detail to make it unique. The statement can be written in two sentences, which helps keep it brief and to the point. Here is a sentence-by-sentence breakdown to make the most of this short, concise statement:
 * First sentence: Simply state the field you want to work in or the specific job you want to have. For instance, you may write that you want to be an insurance broker for a large insurer or a mechanical engineer at a top company.
 * Second sentence. Explain your reason for setting the career goal in your first sentence. Perhaps you want to make improvements to how insurance policies are sold to young people or develop new technology for the oil sector.
* Include your vision statement in your resume. The best place to add your career vision statement is to your objectives section. This placement gives potential employers a clear idea of how your previous education and work experience translates into your ambitions for the future.



### Self development

When an employee has a chance to reflect on (and select) their own development goals, instead of being given goals, they’re more likely to be intrinsically motivated to improve. 
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors have I developed over the last [time frame] that enabled me to be successful?
  * Consider how it has made you successful and give specific examples.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors would have helped me better achieve my goals over the last [time frame]?
  * Consider goals that you have not achieved yet and goals you could have achieved easier or faster.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I wish I had developed over the last [time frame] but were not able to yet?
  * Have you set yourself a development goal that you haven’t achieved yet but still would like to?
* How have my goals and priorities (performance or development) changed over the last [time frame]?
* What behavior(s) have I consistently demonstrated that align to [company name]’s values?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors have I achieved over the last [time frame] that I could continue to develop to build on this achievement?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to reach my goals for the next [time frame]?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to reach the next stage at (Company)?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to realize my long term career aspirations?
* How might I leverage my strengths to achieve my goals?
* Of the opportunities identified, what are the 1-2 I want to set as goals to reach over this [time frame]? 
* What are the potential obstacles I have to overcome to reach my goals?
  * Are these obstacles a skill or knowledge deficit or are they something that is outside of your control?
* What would be the impact of reaching my goals on? The business and my career
* Remembering my strengths, what are the 1-2 next steps I will take to achieve my development goals?
 * For example, any L&D resources, or experts, you can take advantage of? Bonus points for writing as “if x happens, I will do y”. Commit to a date by when you will have accomplished this.

### Brag doc

I think it’s okay to make it quite long / comprehensive – 5-10 pages or more for a year of work doesn’t seem like too much to me, especially if you’re including some graphs/charts / screenshots to show the effects of what you did.

* Goals for this year and Goals for next year
* Projects: For each one, list contribution and impact. Impact may need to comeback and fill later
* Collaboration & mentorship
* Design & documentation: List design docs & documentation that you worked on
* Company building: “things you did to help the company overall, not just your project / team”
* What you learned: try listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently



###icebox
Request in 2018, but got rejected in 2019-09:
As a scrum master, I would like an icebox feature so that when I am planning, I have place to put issues on hold for now, but but still keep them in sight.  
We have the sprint above the backlog.  We would like the icebox below the backlog.  I could do the same by creating a sprint called "icebox" but it appears above the backlog.  Instead, it should be below the backlog.  

Either create a status called icebox and allow transition from to do, OR (do what I do) and create a sprint called icebox.
