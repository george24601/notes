Some men have an irresistible desire to justify their every action. Some like to magnify themselves. Others like to provide an alibi ready for use if needed. Some, perhaps, just don’t think. In any event, they write a letter to some other department or to the boss. The letter first tells how much the writer or his group are doing. Then it puts the finger on others. Just write a few letters like this with plenty of copies sent around, and you’ll dig a grave you’ll never get out of.

We don’t have to use words, either, to be unfair. Did you have to sit in court and listen to a prejudiced witness? He’s too intense. He’s too vehement. Quite evidently, he’s not satisfied with stating the facts as he knows them. No, sir! He’s out to prove the other fellow wrong. Result — nobody pays attention to him. Well, let’s be sure when we sit around a conference-table, we’re not like him. Better state our facts clearly, or our views. But let’s not be too anxious. Let’s not try to push either judge or jury. It doesn’t work.

We have all been approached at some time or other by the Unwise Citer. He asks us to take some action, or refrain from one, solely because certain other people have done so under supposedly like circumstances. The citer, lacking good arguments, has sought to substitute secondhand opinions. This is unfair. It is not helpful. And it directly assaults our ego. We are not given credit for having brains and judgment of our own. Bad stuff.

A somewhat more subtle form of negation, is refinement of measurement. One man says that a tank weights ninety tons. And for that particular discussion, accuracy is of no consequence. Yet someone’s ego speaks up and says, Ninety-two tons. Maybe he’s right at that. But he’s wrong just the same. […] This is a favorite husband-and-wife game. Let’s be on guard against it.

Another thing. Don’t beg. People don’t like it. If then we speak up for some better job that’s open, let’s not till our talk with such words as hoping, thanking, eagerly, favor. If we are really worthy of the job, the Company will benefit by giving it to us every bit as much as we will profit by getting it. The thing works both ways. Why then use begging words that suggest we are thinking of ourselves, not of the Company? And why suggest that we’re not too confident in our ability?

Managers often say they'll reward something – perhaps they even believe it. But then they proceed to reward different things.

I think people are fairly good at predicting this discrepancy. The more productive they are, the better they tend to be at predicting it. Consequently, management's stated goals will tend to go unfulfilled whenever deep down, management doesn't value the sort of work that goes into achieving these goals.

When time comes to reward people, it is the gut feeling of whose work is truly remarkable that matters. And what you usually convince yourself of is that the goal is important – but not that achieving it is remarkable. In fact, often someone pursuing what you think are unimportant goals in a way that you admire will impress you more than someone doing "important grunt work" (in your eyes.)

If something is rotten in an org, the root cause is a manager who doesn't value the work needed to fix it. They might value it being fixed, but of course no sane employee gives a shit about that. A sane employee cares whether they are valued.

As a final step to learning internals, I read recent commits relevant to the subsystems I’ve studied and test that I fully understand why the change was made. This is my “doing the problem set in the back of the textbook” portion of learning.

I either view the commit history of the project or the commit history of a specific file or folder relevant to a subsystem I’ve studied. I then either study the solution first (the changes in the commit) or I see the bug it fixed and attempt to fix it myself and see if I arrive to a similar solution.

To “work the problem”, I’ll checkout the repository at the commit just previous to the commit I’m studying. I’ll reproduce the bug it fixes (if it is a bug fix), and then attempt to implement the solution myself. Finally, I’ll compare my work to the commit done by the maintainer or contributor.

The only hint I'll give myself is the change size necessary (the +/- lines on the VCS diff). I recommend avoiding changes that require more than 50 to 100 changed lines to start.

In contrast, a passive mindset is a fairly unproductive one. As opposed to a targeted and intentional path through uncharted territory, I find that without actively maintained goals and subgoals, my time is spent meandering. After a few hours in this state, it’s not always easy to understand what was accomplished in that time, or where to even pick up when resuming.

To generalize the above example, the basic idea is to lift from a low level abstraction to a high level one. Use what you know about the platforms, underlying framework, or 3rd party APIs to start your search and work bottom up to learn the codebase’s higher level abstractions. Candidate breakpoints include platform APIs (e.g. CreateFile, CreateThread, vkCreateBuffer, etc.), APIs of known dependencies related to your search (e.g. ASIO, Unreal engine APIs, protocol buffers, etc.), or functions that showed up directly in your frame capture.

Now suppose you have a bunch of call stacks. You have the beginnings of a high level grasp of the execution flow of the program. The next order of business is to transition that understanding from execution to data. How are objects modeled? How are they stored? Who maintains what and how are lifetimes controlled? After identifying useful representative callstacks (this is the bottom up approach), the next thing to do is approach the codebase top down by studying the data structures themselves and understanding why and how a given callstack was formed.

When teams try to meet the imaginary timeline produced by the crystal ball, tunnel vision creeps in. Like a Fata Morgana that appears when you’re stuck in the desert, the only thing everyone sees is the looming deadline. The whole discussion reverts to ‘How can we meet that deadline?’ while ‘Is it good enough?’ moves to the backseat, and ‘How can we move faster?’ climbs into the driver’s seat.

Obsessive focus on ‘When will it be done?’ guarantees you will move the delivery of value to the backseat.

### reduce filler

We use these words as a verbal place holder when we are thinking — while communicating. They are a verbal representation of our thinking and an indication to our listener that we are not yet done communicating. They are a signal that what we are saying is getting ahead of what we are thinking.

Additionally, practicing your speech will definitively reduce your use of filler words. When we are prepared for any communications scenario we are more focused and effective in our deliver. 

A better habit than abuse/overuse of filler words is to allow yourself to pause. Doing so will allow you to think about what you will say next without filling the space with words that don’t serve your communication. Pause, then construct what you are going to say internally before you open your mouth.

A pause of silence allows us to think of what we’ll say next, stay centered and focused on the accuracy and effectiveness of our communication.

Speaking at a less hurried pace alongside these other techniques will help minimize your use of these meaningless words. 

. With any important speech you should practice and record it at least 3-5 times. After each attempt, review your recording and count how often you used filler words. Note the number of filler words and then run through your speech again with an effort to relax, center yourself, and use pauses or words that serve your communication instead. Remember to slow down and be mindful of your word choice

As you listen to your recorded sessions (audio or video) take note of what filler words you use and their frequency. Knowing your habits is a first step in a rising self-awareness that will bring freedom from these poor habits.

Using filler words is a sign of nervousness and lack of preparation. Audiences are connected to confident speakers, and crutch words may detract from an otherwise excellent speech.

In order to start the process of elimination, you must become aware of your favorite filler words,” Smith says. “Personally, my go-to word was ‘so.’ Once I became aware of that, I realized my pattern of usage. Moving forward, during presentations I would mentally catch myself about to say 'so' and pause to avoid verbalizing it

Forcing yourself to notice other people’s less-than-eloquent speech patterns, too, can make you conscious of how often you slip “like” into daily conversations, say “um” before answering questions at cocktail parties, or lead sentences with an unnecessary “so” during work presentations.

While you can’t really prep canned answers for life’s impromptu conversations, knowing which situations exacerbate your verbal crutch dependency is a good place to start. This way, for example, you can head into that cocktail party or pitch meeting with some foresight, ready to catch yourself before “so” and “um” sneak out too often.

If you’re a person who likes to write out what you plan to say, be sure to eliminate compound sentences, never start with a prepositional phrase, put most of your sentences in subject/predicate order and eliminate any vocabulary that you have difficulty saying without hesitating. The basic idea is to write for the ear, not the eye!

the optimum frequency is about one filler per minute, but the average speaker uses five fillers per minute — or, one every twelve seconds.

As long as the pause isn’t too long (no more than five seconds), the audience won’t hold it against you

 On average, the optimal ratio of preparation to performance is one hour of practice for every minute of presentation, but at the very least

, recommends speakers get in at least three full runs before stepping in front of an audience.


### Wallenda factor

 beliefs influence attitude which affects behavior. What we notice in the behaviors of others
will reinforce or challenge their underlying belief structure and attitude.

Self regard is an intrinsic judgment, while the “Wallenda Factor” is an extrinsic judgment about producing an
outcome.  The Wallenda Factor relates to one’s perception of the
outcome of an event.

 ‘All karl thought about for three straight months prior to it was falling. It was the first
time he’d ever thought about that, and it seemed to me that he put all his energies into not falling rather than walking the tightrope

When his team dropped its first
game after 29 straight home court victories, we called to see how he felt about it. His response
was vintage Wallenda: ‘Great! Now I can start concentrating on winning, not on not losing.’
Meyer helped frame for us what we’re now referring to as the Wallenda factor, the capacity to
embrace positive goals, to pour one’s energies into the task, not into looking behind and
dredging up excuses for past events.

That is, as organizations strive to
accomplish challenging outcomes, there will be setbacks. When the mindset is that of learning and not
failing, then the learning helps drive people to produce the set of intended outcomes

Build self-confidence through
high expectations. Successful
leaders have high expectations,
both of themselves and of their
consituents.

the expectation that an
employee can perform at a level that he/she does not
see himself/herself capable of achieving. Creates a shift
in the individual’s confidence that he/she can perform at
the higher level—and then does so.

Before you can achieve the kind of life you want, you must think, act, talk, and conduct
yourself in all of your affairs as would the person you wish to become. Attitude is not the
result of success; success is the result of positive attitudes.

Fear of failure makes you focus on limiting risks instead of focusing on maximizing an opportunity for success
