### Daily scrum
* This doesn't mean the Scrum Master should attend the Daily Scrum every day. Put differently: a Scrum Master shouldn't have an active role at all. The Development Team should talk to each other to discuss the progress towards the Sprint Goal. As a Scrum Master, take some (physical) distance, observe the team doing the Daily Scrum. This also prevents the Daily Scrum becoming a status-update towards the Scrum Master. Notice what is discussed and also what isn't being said. Notice who is actively contributing and who isn't really paying attention. Maybe ask some questions afterwards, give feedback etc.o

### Spring planning

* Checks previous development speed (in JIRA Agile: Reports > Velocity Chart) and member availability
* Specific use stories are then added to the sprint from the product backlog.  
* After forming spring backlog, checks once again feasibility of the dynamics and opens the sprint
* Reminds team members to break sprint backlog items into necessary tasks
* Don’t pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can’t be completed in the sprint. You don’t want to set yourself or your team up for failure.
* Also, don’t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.

### Backlog Grooming
* Reminds Product Owner to prioritize product backlog items, write user stories and define acceptance criteria (INVEST guideline: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Short and Testable)
* Product Backlog is the primary list of work that needs to get done maintained by the product owner or product manager. This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, the team’s “To Do” list.
* For a one-month sprint, consider time-boxing your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.
* Do ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order. This can be a big challenge that could derail the process if it’s not properly managed.


### Sprint Review
* Checks status of stories and closes the sprint
* Reminds in what measure is sprint successful (in JIRA Agile: Reports > Sprint Report)
* At Atlassian, we usually demonstrate the “increment” during the end-of-sprint demo, where the team shows what was completed in the sprint. 

### Sprint Retrospective


A Scrum Master should offer services to the Development Team, Product Owner and the organization. Some examples of these services are coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality, helping the Product Owner finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management and supporting the organization in its Scrum adoption.

Quite often, part-time Scrum Masters spend most of their time offering services to the Development Team. This can be very useful; however, to truly succeed with Scrum you should balance your focus on all three levels.

Offering services on these three levels is often not feasible for part-time Scrum Masters.

Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan."

Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting s#it done.  

In kanban, however, the number of tasks or the work in progress (WIP limit) to be implemented in the current cycle is fixed at first. The time taken to implement these features is then calculated backward.

Kanban is not as structured as scrum. Other than the WIP limit, it is fairly open to interpretation. Scrum, however, has several categorical concepts enforced as part of its implementation such as sprint review, retrospective, daily scrum, etc.

Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies done, like work from another team, designs, and legal sign-off.

The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by iteration (scrum).  

Only do so if your organization is committed to scrum, and invested in the process. All the above roles can manage a development team in a myriad of ways but a scrum master can only be effective with 100% buy-in on scrum. Full stop.

### icebox

Request in 2018, but got rejected in 2019-09:
As a scrum master, I would like an icebox feature so that when I am planning, I have place to put issues on hold for now, but but still keep them in sight.  
We have the sprint above the backlog.  We would like the icebox below the backlog.  I could do the same by creating a sprint called "icebox" but it appears above the backlog.  Instead, it should be below the backlog.  

Either create a status called icebox and allow transition from to do, OR (do what I do) and create a sprint called icebox.
