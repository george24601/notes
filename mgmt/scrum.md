 So many of the core concepts in the agile manifesto are reinforced through retrospecitve meetings. Consider the following values: 

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Responding to change over following a plan

Only do so if your organization is committed to scrum, and invested in the process. All the above roles can manage a development team in a myriad of ways but a scrum master can only be effective with 100% buy-in on scrum. Full stop.

Iteration/sprint planning meetings – Protect the team from over-committing and scope creep. Aid in estimation and sub task creation.

Stand-ups are part of many agile cultures, but it doesn’t mean that the team can’t discuss the effectiveness of stand-ups in retrospectives.

Product owners should review the backlog before each iteration planning meeting to ensure prioritization is correct and feedback from the last iteration has been incorporated. Regular review of the backlog is often called "backlog grooming" in agile circles(some use the term backlog refinement).

The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owner's pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually (kanban) or by iteration (scrum).  

Iteration review is a time to showcase the work of the team. They can be in a casual format like "demo Fridays", or in a more formal meeting structure. This is the time for the team to celebrate their accomplishments, demonstrate work finished within the iteration, and get immediate feedback from project stakeholders. 

 But be careful planning too upfront.  Instead of building the most complete, “every minute of the sprint is accounted for” sprint plan, focus on the goal and build enough of a sprint backlog to get started

For complex work, the level of information you know at the start can be low, and much of it is based on assumptions. Scrum is an empirical process, meaning that you can’t plan upfront, but rather learn by doing, and then feed that information back into the process.

If you have a two-week sprint, run a backlog refinement meeting in the middle of the sprint. It’s great for the team to step back from the sprint and look at what's next. Not only does it help prepare for sprint planning, but also can give a different perspective for the current work.

You cannot do sprint planning without the product owner or the development team. The product owner defines the goal based on the value that they seek. The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that goal. If either is missing from this event it makes planning the sprint almost impossible.

product backlog - groomed backlog?

The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal. Ultimately, the resulting sprint plan is a negotiation between the development team and product owner based on value and effort.

You need to decide on how long the time box is going to be, the sprint goal, and where you're going to start. The sprint planning session kicks off the sprint by setting the agenda and focus.

Also, don’t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.

Don’t pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can’t be completed in the sprint. You don’t want to set yourself or your team up for failure.

Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies done, like work from another team, designs, and legal sign-off.

Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and how success will be measured. This is the key to keeping everyone aligned and moving forward toward a common destination.
Do ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order. This can be a big challenge that could derail the process if it’s not properly managed.

During a sprint, the team checks in during the daily scrum, or standup, about how the work is progressing. The goal of this meeting is to surface any blockers and challenges that would impact the teams ability to deliver the sprint goal.

After a sprint, the team demonstrates what they’ve completed during the sprint review. This is your team’s opportunity to showcase their work to stakeholders and teammates before it hits production.

The work items chosen and the plan for how to get them done is called the sprint backlog. By the end of sprint planning the team is ready to start work on the sprint backlog

Choosing the right work items for a sprint is a collaborative effort between the product owner, scrum master, and development team. The product owner discusses the objective that the sprint should achieve and the product backlog items that, upon completion, would achieve the sprint goal.

Sprint planning is a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions: What work can get done in this sprint and how will the chosen work get done?

Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan."

Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting s#it done.  

Scrum focuses on smaller, fixed-length iterations. Once the time period for a sprint is finalized, the stories or product backlog entries that can be implemented during this sprint cycle are then determined. In kanban, however, the number of tasks or the work in progress (WIP limit) to be implemented in the current cycle is fixed at first. The time taken to implement these features is then calculated backward.

Kanban is not as structured as scrum. Other than the WIP limit, it is fairly open to interpretation. Scrum, however, has several categorical concepts enforced as part of its implementation such as sprint review, retrospective, daily scrum, etc.

Sprint review: At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment. The development team showcases the backlog items that are now ‘Done’ to stakeholders and teammates for feedback. The product owner can decide whether or not to release the increment, although in most cases the increment is released.

This review meeting is also when the product owner reworks the product backlog based on the current sprint, which can feed into the next sprint planning session. For a one-month sprint, consider time-boxing your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.

Sprint planning: The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. This meeting is led by the scrum master and is where the team decides on the sprint goal. Specific use stories are then added to the sprint from the product backlog.  These stories always align with the goal and are also agreed upon by the scrum team to be feasible to implement during the sprint.

At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.

Organize the backlog: Sometimes known as backlog grooming, this event is the responsibility of the product owner. The product owner’s main jobs are to drive the product towards its product vision and have a constant pulse on the market and the customer.

Product Backlog is the primary list of work that needs to get done maintained by the product owner or product manager. This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. It is, essentially, the team’s “To Do” list. The product backlog is constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner

Increment (or Sprint Goal) is the usable end-product from a sprint. At Atlassian, we usually demonstrate the “increment” during the end-of-sprint demo, where the team shows what was completed in the sprint. You may not hear the word “increment” out in the world, as it’s often referred to as the team’s definition of “Done”, a milestone, the sprint goal, or even a full version or a shipped epic.

Backlog Grooming
* Reminds Product Owner to prioritize product backlog items, write user stories and define acceptance criteria (INVEST guideline: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Short and Testable)

Spring planning
* Checks previous development speed (in JIRA Agile: Reports > Velocity Chart) and member availability
* After forming spring backlog, checks once again feasibility of the dynamics and opens the sprint
Reminds team members to break sprint backlog items into necessary tasks

Sprint Review
* Checks status of stories and closes the sprint
* Reminds in what measure is sprint successful (in JIRA Agile: Reports > Sprint Report)

Sprint Retrospective
* Reminds in what measure we completed action steps from previous sprint
* Collects what we did good and bad, writes down actions steps and shares them with team members




if you rotate the Scrum Master role you won't succeed with Scrum. However, you will succeed with Zombie-Scrum. At first sight Zombie Scrum seems to be normal Scrum. But it lacks a beating heart. 

Without a Scrum Master, who will be...
Responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted?
Ensuring the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules?
The servant-leader for the Scrum Team supporting the growth of every individual?
Coaching the team in continuous improvement and the organization in truly collaborating with the Scrum Team?
Helping everyone understand the spirit of Scrum?
Providing clear boundaries in which the team can collaborate and self-organization can occur?
Managing impediments, eliminating waste, managing the process, managing the team’s health, managing the boundaries of self‐organization, and managing the culture?
Influencing the organizations culture in such a way the Scrum Teams can truly flourish?

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect and synchronize the team’s progress towards the Sprint Goal, discuss if anything impedes the team and re-plan the team’s work to achieve the Sprint Goal.

This doesn't mean the Scrum Master should attend the Daily Scrum every day. Put differently: a Scrum Master shouldn't have an active role at all. The Development Team should talk to each other to discuss the progress towards the Sprint Goal. As a Scrum Master, take some (physical) distance, observe the team doing the Daily Scrum. This also prevents the Daily Scrum becoming a status-update towards the Scrum Master. Notice what is discussed and also what isn't being said. Notice who is actively contributing and who isn't really paying attention. Maybe ask some questions afterwards, give feedback etc.o

A Scrum Master should offer services to the Development Team, Product Owner and the organization. Some examples of these services are coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality, helping the Product Owner finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management and supporting the organization in its Scrum adoption.

Quite often, part-time Scrum Masters spend most of their time offering services to the Development Team. This can be very useful; however, to truly succeed with Scrum you should balance your focus on all three levels. The life of a Product Owner will become much easier if (s)he is supported by a Scrum Master. And when the environment of the Scrum Team (other employees and stakeholders) understand what Scrum is really about, the Scrum adoption as a whole will truly take off.

Offering services on these three levels is often not feasible for part-time Scrum Masters.
