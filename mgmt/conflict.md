Often the meaning we put on other's behaivor is based on misunderstanding of their deeper intent and feelings or needs

Important not to trace to its source and why it occured, but how to move it forward

Removing specific personalities to avoid clashes will not work because there are benefits and value received from all personality types.

Most conflicts do not get resolved. This is because people have not taken the time to truly understand the root cause of the conflict, and so they only deal with superficial issues.

What do I hope to achieve by addressing this conflict? If you think to yourself, “showing that I’m right,” consider whether this goal is truly in the interest of the best long term outcome

Do I have emotions attached to the conflict that may interfere in my ability to address it effectively? If so, what are they and how can I address them before hand?

It’s important to understand a person’s perspective because once people pick a position they will find it challenging to abandon it, even if they are wrong.

What do they want and need from this situation? (Keep in mind sometimes people just want to be heard and to feel that their opinions and concerns matter more than taking a specific action.)

someone may feel like another employee is doing something hurtful intentionally, while the truth is that the other employee is completely unaware that they are causing harm.


First, brainstorm to identify the core problem that needs to be solved and the 2 to 4 main
positions being taken. Remind the group that the goal is not to determine which position is correct and which is wrong, but rather to use the prevailing viewpoints as a starting point for gaining clarity and identifying possible solutions.

Have the group analyze each position, looking for assumptions, objective facts, and any uncertainty that would warrant additional exploration and fact-finding. Also, have them make note of areas where the viewpoints overlap or have common ground. By considering what leads to other people's positions, the group will gain a better understanding of each other’s perspectives.

Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions


LEAPS communication model

* Increasing intensity levels
  * Differences
  * Misunderstanding
  * Disagreement
  * Discord and competition
  * Polarization

* Conflict is against our instinct, but you must rise to the challenge
* Anyone who can shift into the rational mind and can drive the opponent into the emotional response will have an upper hand.

While you may not agree with what they’re saying, you can still accept it. Accept their views and opinions for what they are, and move forward with your new insight.

Conflict is against our instinct, but you must rise now

Even when one person becomes frustrated, you must strive to maintain a placid appearance. If you, yourself, become frustrated or impassioned, it will be even more difficult for the people having the conflict to calm down and resolve their differences.

Ask each person what caused the conflict, if there have been past conflicts, and get their opinions on how to resolve the situation and prevent future issues.

Try to find a common goal and agree on the solution

Instead of focusing on conflict as a behavior issue, focus on the communication of it

 To enhance this delegation of responsibility, clients sit facing directly across a table from each other, while the mediator sits at a distance from both. This assures that both parties must address each other, directly
