* Does this need to be said
* Does this need to be said by me
* Does this need to be said by me, now
* Can i disagree and commit? Will you trust me on delivering it, even though i disagree?
  * 100% commitment. No sabotoge or half hearted effort. No "I told you so" 
  * Effort to make that decision a success 

Task conflict: differences in methods, approaches
can grow into
Relationship/personality conflict , miscommunications, authority conflict 

Indicators of conflict
* anger and frustration
* lack of trust
* lack of motiviation
* poor decisions, e.g., unclear with goals and not enough focus

Issues that get in the way
* imposing your own goals
* attacking the legimacy of the position and priorities of others
* minimising or ignoring the concerns of others
* supressing differences

Trust is a fundamental part of conflict resolution

Benevolence: the extent to which you beleive I care about you and back you up
Aptitude: the extent to which you believe I am competent and capable

Affection, trust, Respect, distrust

Propensity to trust: Suspicions - judgement - gullible

Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions

We tend to exaggerate during arguments
* causes of the situation
* consequences of the situation
* conditions of the resolution
Focus on the outcome you want from the conflict, rather than the need of you being heard

Conflict toxin kicks in when what is said is taken literally.
* Let it pass
* Ask using neutral, open questions
* Main reason for the conflict to continue is to focus on the position, rather than interests
  * Ask why such position is important to them
  * motive often different from what they say
* often don't mean what they say
* tune into other people's motivations

LEAPS communication model

Increasing intensity levels
* Differences
* misunderstanding
* disagreement
* discord and competition
* Polarization

More intense conflicts are harder to handle. 
Can easily escalate by an ill-judged comment combined with an unfiltered response

When someone is at the fight position - disarm
* Don't aggrevate them by body language
  * pointing fingers
  * shaking hands
  * Let them express the burst of anger, and keep the neutral facial expression and body position
  * paraphase the information
  * question the concerns
  * calm and confident position
  * Use the pace to lower the energy 

flight position - intervening
* avoid BL that is pushy or impatient
  * extended eye contacts
  * leaning in close
* clarify what you head with qualities and quantities their points
* use open body/hand gestures to represent 2-3 options, and ask if a decision would address their concern

Anyone who can shift into the rational mind and can drive the opponent into the emotional response will have an upper hand.

The awkward silence: when faced with an insult or a challenging questions, pause and think deepingly before answering
helps move into the rational mind. Keep emotion under control. Answering what you believe rather than what others want to hear.

Thomas-Kilman Conflict Mode assessment
* assertive - own needs
* cooperative

competitive - collaborative - compromising in the middle -  accommondating - avoiding 

Compromising
When works
 * time constraint
 * relationship is importatnt
 * both sides equally strong argument
 * moderately important goals
 * temp mode for complex issues
 * backup mode for collaboration
Not good
 * strategic or goals are involved
 * break of committment

Competing
 * goal oriented
 * quick, difficult, or unpopular deicisons
 * when people take advantage of you
Not good
 * hurs others
 * when there is resistence or sabotage

Collaborating
 * goal oriented and people oriented
 * creative solutions
 * need good negotion skills
 * when objective to learn
 * both parties are willing to collaborate
 * merge insights from different povs
 * can't compromise both parties goals
Not good
 * when lack of time
 * problem is trivial
 * no interesting in collaborating

Avoiding
  * mode of dipomancy
  * trivial info
  * pick your battle
Not good
  * the message is not heard
  * the problem won't go away

Accomodating
 * people oriented approach
 * need to build relationships
Not good
 * can't please everyone 
 * bad ideas
 * expectations/roles are 


The words could have a big impact
* "yes, but" 
  * negate the other's contribution
  * position your idea as the right now
* "yes, and"
  * affirming other's ideas
  * communicating that they have been heard
  * building upon their ideas
* then to use "but" rather than "and" in the heat of discussion
* 
Third party intervention
* listen carefully and dispassionately
* agree and establish observable elements that will have an impact on the decision and outcome
* ask them how to resolve the issue and to move forward
* get agreed on what is agreed and the way forward

important not to trace to its source and why it occured, but how to move it forward

reduce aggression as much as possible

put over challenge assertively without aggression and with clear goals. So you know where you are, and you know where you want to be. 
* maybe just agreesing on goals and outcomes
