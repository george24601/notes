Stages of dialogue
* preparation
  * work through your thoughts and feelings
  * What is my intent going into this conversation?
    * often unaware
* invitation
  * conversation starts poorly most likely ends poorly
  * Use soft start
    * something i have been thinking about lately
    * I'd like to know you your point of view
  * disatisfaction rather than blame
    * I feel like I am the one doing all the clean up
    * You people are such slobs
  * use repair attempts throughput the conversation
    * de-escalate the tension
  * leveling statement
    * starting stage or de-escalate during the dialouge
    * state a concern w/o blame or hostality 
    * express your desire to understand the other person's point of view
    * let them know you'd like to work things out together
    * focus on the process of communication rather than content
    * It was upsetting to me to learn about the memo. However, I want to understand your pov and then figure out how we can better communication and coordniate our work in the future.
    * I was surprised by what you said this morning during our coffee break. It seems you have some strong feels about this matter which i'd like to understand.
    * I've been feeling uneasy in our relationship, ever since the board meeting in Sep. I'd like to understand your pov and see if we can get back to our previous working relationship  
    * I sense you are not feeling good about our assignments. I am not either. Let's agree to talk about this in an open way until we find a solution we both feel good about
    * I think we have different understanding of what he intended and what is fair to each of us. I'd like to understand your point of view and share mine as well and see if we can work this out
    * I'm not feeling good about how this is escalating and you're prob not either. I want to understand how you are feeling and what we can do to calm our discussion and get it back on track.
  * Clarifying you intent and/or concerns
    * Point out what you do and do not intend
  * Stating your commit to collaboration. Keep going back to it when you are bogged down during exploration
 
#### exploration - hard part

* mistake
  * persuade, convince other into accepting your view at this stage  
    * ignore complexity
    * only pay attention to the data that supports your pov 
  * moving too quickly into problem solving
* inquries and advocacy loop
* different assumptions set up for conflict because of ambiguity  
* Create a pool of shared understanding
  * Surface and understand the assumptions of all partities
  * search for a common and more complete reality
* Shared understanding does not mean agreement
* Start by inquiring the view of others
  * How are you feeling right now about what we've learned
  * 
* Case study: agreeing on property
* priming
  * state your best guess when other side closed down or is struggling identifying thoughts/feelings
  * I would guess you're not in favor of what we've been discussing
  * You prob like to participate but not sure if it is appropriate
  * It seems you were offended by the comment
  * I'll be it has been a difficult statement
* Immediacy
  * When you want to be heard
  * commenting on the process of communication
  * can we take a time out for just a moment?
  * Seems that you are upset by my pov and you start talking over me. I want to hear what you want to say, but I also want to finish what I'm saying
  * Seems that it is hard for you to hear what I have to say


### collaboration
* unmet needs are the heart of the conflict
* People are not fighting solutions, rather what is important to them.
* identify needs and what is important to each party
  * They make promises to customers without having even a clue about how much it takes to build a good product.
  * what is most important to you
* Brainstorming 
  * Make sure everyone understands desired outcome
  * One thought at a time
  * No criticism
  * Outrangous ideas are encouraged 
  * No discussion of ideas except to clarify its meaning
  * Build on other's ideas
* Come up actions or solutions.
* consensus
  * Everyone has contributed to brainstoriming the solution
  * Support a final solution even though their favorite isn't part of it



Conflict: circular - reinforcing circular reaction

Be clear about the outcome you desire during negotiations, but not commiteed to solutions going in


Often the meaning we put on other's behaivor is based on misunderstanding of their deeper intent and feelings or needs



* Conflict triggering event

* Choice
  * trust - dialogue
  * fear - Dominate/avoid/accomodate

Argument/debate vs dialogue, the way to collaborate

Trust building before resolving the conflict


* Does this need to be said
* Does this need to be said by me
* Does this need to be said by me, now

Task conflict: differences in methods, approaches
can grow into
Relationship/personality conflict , miscommunications, authority conflict 

Indicators of conflict
* anger and frustration
* lack of trust

Affection, trust, Respect, distrust

Propensity to trust: Suspicions - judgement - gullible
