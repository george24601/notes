### influcence without authority

My career lesson is that being right isn't the hard part of being a senior staff engineer. Being right isn't enough. It's building alignment across the entire org towards the right solution. That's the hard valuable problem that I'm paid to solve.

The staff engineer was told they were being unreasonable in pushing so hard. Their manager tried to ditch them, but again, they're good at the staff eng game, so they switched teams due to being in the good graces (due to an excellent track record) with a middle manager above them. They decided, hey fuck you, I'm going to one man army this effort. They did, they had preview versions ready in less than a month and had migrated some of the bigger-win jobs within 2, saving their annual comp (which was prodigious) several times over just in that. Suddenly everyone was keen on moving their stuff over now that the startup cost (both political and eng-time) was paid.

5 year plan is sounding really bad, though



Find a partner. This is the most effective way to accelerate your progress. Who do you know who is proven to be a strategic thinker? Enlist them to be your accountability partner. It needs to be someone who’s invested in your success and able to observe your behavior on a regular basis. Let them know that you’re working on your own strategic thinking skills. Ask if they would be willing to provide feedback and tips along the way.

We often find that leaders make assumptions about the skills, capabilities and motivation levels of others by applying a one-size-fits all delegation approach. Instead, good leaders need to asses each individual’s will and skill level in order to determine who can be trusted to handle what, and how much direction vs. support each individual needs. The ultimate goal is to need to provide less hands-on direction and more support.

But you won’t be comfortable delegating until you have a clear understanding of your own highest value activities. This understanding will guide you in determining what other aspects of the business can be delegated to your direct reports. You need to know what only you can do and what can be done by others, while always keeping at the forefront the organization’s goals

Spend 15 minutes at the start of the day determining what to delegate and to whom
Block out 15 minutes at the end of the day to wrap the day’s event into the “big picture”
Block out 30 minutes per day for brainstorming on a different key topic or decision
Block out 1 hour/week for strategic thinking time – no email, phone
Block out 1 day per quarter for a personal strategy “retreat”
Hold department off-sites twice/year to do strategic planning


Where is the business today?
Where does it want to be in six to twelve months?
What changes do I need to make to my teams to support these objectives?
What skills are missing?
What peer relationships do I need to nurture?
What competencies need to be developed in the leadership pipeline?
How are we defining success?

The challenge is to define the key points of collaboration and to avoid involving too many people at any one stage.  Beware of letting important decisions get bogged down with too many unnecessary levels of approvals.

### Personal vision

Career aspirations are not the same as career goals. A goal is usually a more specific, short-term objective with a detailed plan for achieving it.

The difference between the two is subtle but important. 
* A goal usually has a set time frame in which to achieve it. The time required to achieve an aspiration is variable.
* While a goal focuses on achieving a specific, tangible outcome, an aspiration is more general. Aspirations also leave room for different outcomes and results.
* Demonstrate that your aspirations align with the company’s vision and long-term goals
Show the interviewer how the role will help you gain the skills and experience necessary to achieve your career aspirations

The vision statement should typically communicate your goal in 30 to 40 words. 

* Identify your strengths
View your skills as ways to make improvements in your future role. When it comes to using your statement to advance your career, approach the job market with positivity and confidence in order to convince potential employers that you are the best candidate for the job.
* Reflect on your values 
Is it important that your work gives back to society?
Do you prioritize work-life balance?
Are you motivated by inspiring others?
Do you believe in taking responsibility for your own actions?
* Evaluate how your skills can solve real-world issues
 * What issues are you passionate about?
 * Are there issues that your personal strengths are particularly well-suited to tackling?
 * Are there certain issues, like human rights or financial regulation, that fit well with your core values?
* Your aim should be to keep the statement concise while giving enough detail to make it unique. The statement can be written in two sentences, which helps keep it brief and to the point. Here is a sentence-by-sentence breakdown to make the most of this short, concise statement:
 * First sentence: Simply state the field you want to work in or the specific job you want to have. For instance, you may write that you want to be an insurance broker for a large insurer or a mechanical engineer at a top company.
 * Second sentence. Explain your reason for setting the career goal in your first sentence. Perhaps you want to make improvements to how insurance policies are sold to young people or develop new technology for the oil sector.
* Include your vision statement in your resume. The best place to add your career vision statement is to your objectives section. This placement gives potential employers a clear idea of how your previous education and work experience translates into your ambitions for the future.



### Self development

When an employee has a chance to reflect on (and select) their own development goals, instead of being given goals, they’re more likely to be intrinsically motivated to improve. 
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors have I developed over the last [time frame] that enabled me to be successful?
  * Consider how it has made you successful and give specific examples.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors would have helped me better achieve my goals over the last [time frame]?
  * Consider goals that you have not achieved yet and goals you could have achieved easier or faster.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I wish I had developed over the last [time frame] but were not able to yet?
  * Have you set yourself a development goal that you haven’t achieved yet but still would like to?
* How have my goals and priorities (performance or development) changed over the last [time frame]?
* What behavior(s) have I consistently demonstrated that align to [company name]’s values?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors have I achieved over the last [time frame] that I could continue to develop to build on this achievement?

* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to reach the next stage at (Company)?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to realize my long term career aspirations?
* How might I leverage my strengths to achieve my goals?
* Of the opportunities identified, what are the 1-2 I want to set as goals to reach over this [time frame]? 
* What are the potential obstacles I have to overcome to reach my goals?
  * Are these obstacles a skill or knowledge deficit or are they something that is outside of your control?
* What would be the impact of reaching my goals on? The business and my career
* Remembering my strengths, what are the 1-2 next steps I will take to achieve my development goals?
 * For example, any L&D resources, or experts, you can take advantage of? Bonus points for writing as “if x happens, I will do y”. Commit to a date by when you will have accomplished this.

### Brag doc

* Goals for this year and Goals for next year
* Projects: For each one, list contribution and impact. Impact may need to comeback and fill later
* Collaboration & mentorship
* Design & documentation: List design docs & documentation that you worked on
* Company building: “things you did to help the company overall, not just your project / team”
* What you learned: try listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently
