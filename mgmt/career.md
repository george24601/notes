Once, I was participating in a design standup, during which UX designers shared what they’re currently working on and elicited feedback from their team members. One designer shared a flow that asked users to create an account and provide contact information. We discussed the design possibilities in great detail, including the proper order for collecting primary versus secondary contact information. After a lively debate, one person finally asked the right questions: What’s the overall goal here? What information is essential? What do we need to do with it once we’ve collected it? 

During analysis of your research findings, it’s important to focus on your participants’ deeper needs and wants, not simply accept their initial suggestions. For example, if a participant says she wants color-coded communications, dig deeper to find out why she wants this. Does she need quick visual cues to aid in skimming content, or does she just want more color in her life? Her answer will have significant design and product implications.

Make sure you don’t make assumptions based on what research participants say. Instead continue questioning participants until you fully understand their deeper needs. If you find a user has suggested color coding to help her categorize and scan communications more quickly, you can consider other options that would also aid quick skimming—such as clearer subject lines or having a consistent structure across all communications. As a researcher, you need to thoroughly understand the users’ problem and leave their solutions to product, design, and development.

Once you’ve collected abundant, rich data from your qualitative research sessions, you’ll need to sift through your data to identify the valuable insights that address your main goals. But don’t be tricked by fool’s gold! At first, it might be painful to disregard much of your data, but this is necessary to gain clarity. The most digestible, effective research reports are concise, clearly organized, and succinctly address the key research questions through an engaging narrative.


Our stakeholders wanted to focus on the usability issues because we had the most control over them, but we weren’t sure that fixing the usability issues would address the larger awareness and adoption issues. We raised this issue, asking our stakeholders to clarify our key goals for the research—improving adoption or improving usability? Only once our team had agreed upon our main goal could I start planning appropriately targeted research.

Sometimes we throw ourselves into planning and executing our user research, getting caught up in the details, until someone barges in and asks a simple question: Why? Why are we doing this? What is the overall goal of the research?

If strategic thinking is your goal, you must master your ability to break free periodically from the day-to-day in order to think more broadly, beyond your functional area and onto the bigger picture. When he was running Microsoft, Bill Gates was known to take entire weeks off to ruthlessly prioritize and ponder solutions, not deal with problems. 

Find a partner. This is the most effective way to accelerate your progress. Who do you know who is proven to be a strategic thinker? Enlist them to be your accountability partner. It needs to be someone who’s invested in your success and able to observe your behavior on a regular basis. Let them know that you’re working on your own strategic thinking skills. Ask if they would be willing to provide feedback and tips along the way.

Many managers find themselves in this trap – they are still so attached to the day-to-day execution of tasks that they have no brain space to do the strategic work necessary to advance themselves and their teams

One great way to do this is with the classic six thinking hats methods: 

White Hat: With this thinking hat, you focus on what you can learn from the available data, current and past trends. 
Red Hat: You look at problems through the lens of feelings (yours and others), using your intuition and emotion.    
Black Hat: Is the hat of caution. Look for weak points and think about how to create contingency plans to counter them. 
Yellow Hat: Helps you look at the bright side. What is the most optimistic viewpoint?
Green Hat: Uses creativity and leans into freewheeling, out-of-the-box ideas   
Blue Hat: This hat represents processes and prompts you to bring order and structure to your thoughts

For example, ask your team to come to a brainstorming meeting with three suggestions already formulated. If they bring a problem to you, coach them by asking questions like:

What possibilities have you considered?
If you were me, how would you approach this problem?
Based on your experience, what do you propose as a next step? 



If you’ve ever received feedback that you “need to be more strategic,” you know how frustrating it can feel. To add insult to injury, the feedback rarely comes with any concrete guidance on what to do about it.

Be proactive about connecting with peers both in your organization and in your industry to understand their observations of the marketplace. Then, share your findings across your network.
Understand the unique information and perspective that your function provides and define its impact on the corporate level strategy.
For example, when working on an employee retention project she asked herself, “What does success look like in Year 1?”  “What does it look like in Year 3?” “What could impact the outcome in a negative way?” “What are the early signs of success/failure?” “What do business partners need to understand to ensure its success?” and “Do the outcomes support the broader goals of the organization?” By asking these tough questions first, she recognized that she could better engage with colleagues and senior executives early on in ways that would benefit the project — and would help shape the perception that she was thoughtful and strategic.

Common obstacles for leaders
| “I’m not very organized with my time…”
| “I don’t feel like I am adding value if I am not ‘doing’…”
| “I don’t delegate to my team members as much as I should…”
| “I don’t really know how to step back…”

But the transition from tactical leadership to strategic leadership calls on you to ask questions rather than answer them, to focus on your highest value work rather than “block and tackle,” to chart new paths rather than continue to operate within and execute the status quo.

The tactical mindset is about getting things done, putting out fires and being the expert. The strategic mindset is about aligning with organizational objectives, discovering the unknowns and being a facilitator between ideas, people and plans.

Are you setting a large portion of your time aside for strategic big picture activities like visioning and relationship building?
Are you proactively going into your quarter, month, weeks and days with the big picture in mind and structuring your activities accordingly?
Are you getting the most strategic activities done first?
How are you structuring your thinking?
Do you have the end in mind?

Being more strategic doesn’t necessarily mean making decisions that affect the whole organization. Nurturing a relationship, such as one that could provide unique insight into a supplier, a customer or a competitor can be highly strategic.

We often find that leaders make assumptions about the skills, capabilities and motivation levels of others by applying a one-size-fits all delegation approach. Instead, good leaders need to asses each individual’s will and skill level in order to determine who can be trusted to handle what, and how much direction vs. support each individual needs. The ultimate goal is to need to provide less hands-on direction and more support.

But you won’t be comfortable delegating until you have a clear understanding of your own highest value activities. This understanding will guide you in determining what other aspects of the business can be delegated to your direct reports. You need to know what only you can do and what can be done by others, while always keeping at the forefront the organization’s goals

As a senior leader, highest value activities often include:

Coaching direct reports to build a leadership pipeline and improve retention
Nurturing strategic relationships with peers and brokering connections to break down silos and foster greater collaboration
Bringing the big picture view to your teams that are focused necessarily on their specific tasks and goals, by creating a climate that sets them up for success
Challenging the status quo to spark innovation
Creating a culture that supports the vision and values of the organization

Relationship building with people from across the industry helps to cross-pollinate ideas. The intention is to get outside the bubble. Bubbles don’t just keep others out. They keep you in.



Action Steps: List down the things you KNOW you’re bad at. Hate email? Write it down. Want to spend a majority of your time on small details, even if it takes a lot of time? Write that down.

Whatever your “bad” things are, consciously be aware of those things and find someone who is good at them!

Merely fantasizing about your goal is de-motivating–it actually tricks the brain into thinking you already have achieved it.
Goals that aren’t set up properly can end up having the opposite effect.

Many clients know what they don’t want but aren’t as clear on what they do want. You need to be clear on what you want before you can effectively move forward.
Some clients have gotten into the habit of making decisions based on what’s best for their career, family or others, and have forgotten to assess their own needs and desires.
Others know to some extent what they want, but it’s not nearly specific enough for them to go out and get it. Saying “I want a new job” is really different than saying “I want a part-time job where I can be surrounded by like-minded people in sports entertainment.”


Spend 15 minutes at the start of the day determining what to delegate and to whom
Block out 15 minutes at the end of the day to wrap the day’s event into the “big picture”
Block out 30 minutes per day for brainstorming on a different key topic or decision
Block out 1 hour/week for strategic thinking time – no email, phone
Block out 1 day per quarter for a personal strategy “retreat”
Hold department off-sites twice/year to do strategic planning

Leaders need to prioritize setting aside time to think. Between meetings, emails, phone calls and actual work, there’s little time for strategic reflection unless you plan for it.

Without time for reflection, decision making becomes reflexive and based on past experience rather than a clear perspective on the current situation and potential opportunities. To come up with new, innovative approaches and to be able to gauge the likelihood of success, you need to devote some serious time to thinking.

Expanding your perspective also involves actively seeking information outside your sphere: both within your organization and outside it. Developing stronger connections with peers, both internally and externally, as well as with customers through regular conversation will improve insight into current situations

As a senior leader, highest value activities often include:

Coaching direct reports to build a leadership pipeline and improve retention
Nurturing strategic relationships with peers and brokering connections to break down silos and foster greater collaboration
Bringing the big picture view to your teams that are focused necessarily on their specific tasks and goals, by creating a climate that sets them up for success
Challenging the status quo to spark innovation
Creating a culture that supports the vision and values of the organization

The ultimate goal is to need to provide less hands-on direction and more support.

When you first get promoted to a senior leadership position, one of the hardest parts of the transition is getting out of the weeds. Let’s face it: every potential use of your time is not equally important. You have to prioritize and focus on the things that need your attention.

Where is the business today?
Where does it want to be in six to twelve months?
What changes do I need to make to my teams to support these objectives?
What skills are missing?
What peer relationships do I need to nurture?
What competencies need to be developed in the leadership pipeline?
How are we defining success?

Strategic leaders are always tapping into the vision, values and goals of the organization and finding ways to align to it. They are constantly looking at where they want to take the business, what is needed to get there and how to make the best use of the talent on hand. They look for gaps to fill as well as hidden resources.

With the larger goals of the organization top of mind, they look for connections they can make across functional teams, departments and even operations. They put as much value in building relationships with peers as they do coaching their teams and building a leadership pipeline.

Are you setting a large portion of your time aside for strategic big picture activities like visioning and relationship building?
Are you proactively going into your quarter, month, weeks and days with the big picture in mind and structuring your activities accordingly?
Are you getting the most strategic activities done first?
How are you structuring your thinking?
Do you have the end in mind?

But the transition from tactical leadership to strategic leadership calls on you to ask questions rather than answer them, to focus on your highest value work rather than “block and tackle,” to chart new paths rather than continue to operate within and execute the status quo.

The challenge is to define the key points of collaboration and to avoid involving too many people at any one stage.  Beware of letting important decisions get bogged down with too many unnecessary levels of approvals.

The idea in action: Map out the process as simply as possible and then use it to test a likely scenario with those who will be responsible for the decision’s success. Once you have learned and tweaked the process, set clear expectations, timing, and cultural accountability.

 "How do I make sure I'm thinking about the big picture, when I'm always working on a lot of small things that seem to take up all my time?"

If you're in a management position, consider buddying with someone who reports to you: teammates who don't often get the chance to strategize will be energized by the opportunity to do it with you. Through this exercise, your teammates will get a sense of ownership over the conclusions you come to together, while you'll gain focus and clarity.

Big questions are worth asking but they should be framed in a way that doesn't feel burdensome or insurmountable. If they do, decompose them into smaller pieces until each one feels doable. Identify a problem and several solutions. For example: How can I help the designers who report to me be as effective as possible? Solutions: Establish a mentorship program or a process for critique.

 Reflect on the activities that helped you move ahead or wasted your time. Reflection time each day allows you to ask yourself if you what you learned and how to stay on track with your goals. This is where inspiration and creativity have a chance to grow and be seen. 

Executives cannot afford to work the same way that they did when they were at a lower level because their scope, responsibilities, and expectations have completely changed.

Take a step back from working out “how” they are going to “do” something and think about what they are trying to achieve.


Whenever you find yourself trying to make a big decision, move forward with some area of your life, overcome a challenge or obstacle or just feel like things aren’t where you want them to be, it’s important to take a step back, look at the big picture and identify what you really want before you move forward. When you step back from your life, your career, your path and look from a bit of a distance, you see things from a different perspective.

When things are busy, but limited tangible progress is being made towards your end goal, you should take a step back and assess why.

I utilized this break to  reevaluate what was important for the business and then understand where I was spending my time.  After my brainstorm, my number one priority is to focus the majority of my effort doing things that have a direct, positive impact for my students.  Things like creating new online courses, recording additional content to current courses, high student engagement, etc.  When I matched this renewed vision with where I had been spending my time over the past few months, I was shocked.  Only 15% of my time was being spent doing the things I had deemed the most important. 

Like everything, strategic thinking takes practice. If you don’t prioritise it, you’ll drop it in favour of tasks that might seem urgent, but that won’t get you where you want to be. If you make it a habit, it will become the best time you’ll ever spend.




A few years ago, I was sitting in a meeting with my business partners. We were talking about plans for the upcoming year and how we were going to achieve our goals. We started having a heated discussion about the way we would execute one of our strategic priorities when one of my partners stopped the conversation and said, “Wait guys, let’s take a step back. What are we actually trying to achieve?” It was a great question and one that he often asked.


Instead of burdening yourself with speed, start asking yourself — “What do I need to stop?” How did I perform? How do I compare to my own standards? What’s a new experience you can add to your life or career?

If you don’t see the point in taking a step back every now and then, you can no longer change, grow and improve.

Take some time every quarter or six months to evaluate where you are right now.

Often, people get caught up in the minutia of a task and overlook the impact. Take time to assess the outcome or results of your work, not just the actions you've taken. "What was the challenge I addressed? What specific benefits did my contribution have for my firm?" When you see you've had a positive effect and can label your accomplishment, you may be able to stop overanalyzing and move on.

The key to duplicating yourself is duplicating the systems and processes that allow for quality of work to remain high. For most, this is the biggest step back. You see margins drop and your time expenditure temporarily increases. It is predictably more chaotic and uncomfortable.

On the other side of that hard work, though, is a fully operating replica of your workmanship without you doing the work. For people like the client above, this means not having to turn down jobs or work overtime. You can then duplicate your craftsmanship as needed to service growing business inquiries.

Sometimes we throw ourselves into planning and executing our user research, getting caught up in the details, until someone barges in and asks a simple question: Why?

Work with your stakeholders to carefully craft your research goals. Once you’ve established them, they should be the North Star that guides you as you plan, moderate, analyze, and present your research.

You always need to come back to why you’re doing your research. What do you want to learn? What’s the bigger picture? What are some assumptions you may be taking for granted? What are you ultimately trying to get out of this research?

Once you answer these questions, you can craft your research strategically around these inherent goals to ensure it will have a clear, targeted impact. Without adequate focus on your goals, your research will tend to take on a life of its own and morph into an ill-formed morass. In addition to delineating your research goals up front, it can be helpful to define the expected outcomes of your research. These could be anything from developing a journey map, to better understanding users’ mental models of a feature, to making a decision about the future of a product offering. By pausing to define the desired outcomes at the beginning of your research, you can stay more focused on your goals.

 Our stakeholders wanted to focus on the usability issues because we had the most control over them, but we weren’t sure that fixing the usability issues would address the larger awareness and adoption issues. We raised this issue, asking our stakeholders to clarify our key goals for the research—improving adoption or improving usability? Only once our team had agreed upon our main goal could I start planning appropriately targeted research.

Once you’ve collected abundant, rich data from your qualitative research sessions, you’ll need to sift through your data to identify the valuable insights that address your main goals. But don’t be tricked by fool’s gold! At first, it might be painful to disregard much of your data, but this is necessary to gain clarity.

Tackling a new research problem is exciting and invites creative, critical thinking. But it’s all too easy to jump in and get caught up in the details of crafting just the right wording for an elusive question or cultivating the perfect crescendo of questions. Remember to take a step back and consider the larger picture and the core goals for your research project. Why are you doing this research? What do you hope to get out of it?

Let’s say you’re doing research with Sales, Service, and Implementation associates, studying internal communications around a new product. When creating the research guides for each of these three types of associates, you must maintain coherence and obtain complementary data across all participants, but you also might want to include some questions that are specific to each role. How will you balance convergent and divergent questioning with each associate type? How will you use your overall findings to impact your product’s internal communications strategy? If you pause and take a step back, you can focus on the larger context and goals, which will set you up for success.

Everyone benefits from taking a step back and reframing their perspective. Once, I was participating in a design standup, during which UX designers shared what they’re currently working on and elicited feedback from their team members. One designer shared a flow that asked users to create an account and provide contact information. We discussed the design possibilities in great detail, including the proper order for collecting primary versus secondary contact information. After a lively debate, one person finally asked the right questions: What’s the overall goal here? What information is essential? What do we need to do with it once we’ve collected it? He pulled us out of the weeds and helped us to see the bigger picture, enabling us to make smarter, more informed decisions. Understanding the users’ needs and the goals for the flow helped the designer make it as efficient and enjoyable as possible.








### Personal vision

Career aspirations are not the same as career goals. A goal is usually a more specific, short-term objective with a detailed plan for achieving it.

The difference between the two is subtle but important. 
* A goal usually has a set time frame in which to achieve it. The time required to achieve an aspiration is variable.
* While a goal focuses on achieving a specific, tangible outcome, an aspiration is more general. Aspirations also leave room for different outcomes and results.
* Demonstrate that your aspirations align with the company’s vision and long-term goals
Show the interviewer how the role will help you gain the skills and experience necessary to achieve your career aspirations

The vision statement should typically communicate your goal in 30 to 40 words. 

* Identify your strengths
View your skills as ways to make improvements in your future role. When it comes to using your statement to advance your career, approach the job market with positivity and confidence in order to convince potential employers that you are the best candidate for the job.
* Reflect on your values 
Is it important that your work gives back to society?
Do you prioritize work-life balance?
Are you motivated by inspiring others?
Do you believe in taking responsibility for your own actions?
* Evaluate how your skills can solve real-world issues
 * What issues are you passionate about?
 * Are there issues that your personal strengths are particularly well-suited to tackling?
 * Are there certain issues, like human rights or financial regulation, that fit well with your core values?
* Your aim should be to keep the statement concise while giving enough detail to make it unique. The statement can be written in two sentences, which helps keep it brief and to the point. Here is a sentence-by-sentence breakdown to make the most of this short, concise statement:
 * First sentence: Simply state the field you want to work in or the specific job you want to have. For instance, you may write that you want to be an insurance broker for a large insurer or a mechanical engineer at a top company.
 * Second sentence. Explain your reason for setting the career goal in your first sentence. Perhaps you want to make improvements to how insurance policies are sold to young people or develop new technology for the oil sector.
* Include your vision statement in your resume. The best place to add your career vision statement is to your objectives section. This placement gives potential employers a clear idea of how your previous education and work experience translates into your ambitions for the future.



### Self development

When an employee has a chance to reflect on (and select) their own development goals, instead of being given goals, they’re more likely to be intrinsically motivated to improve. 
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors have I developed over the last [time frame] that enabled me to be successful?
  * Consider how it has made you successful and give specific examples.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors would have helped me better achieve my goals over the last [time frame]?
  * Consider goals that you have not achieved yet and goals you could have achieved easier or faster.
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I wish I had developed over the last [time frame] but were not able to yet?
  * Have you set yourself a development goal that you haven’t achieved yet but still would like to?
* How have my goals and priorities (performance or development) changed over the last [time frame]?
* What behavior(s) have I consistently demonstrated that align to [company name]’s values?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors have I achieved over the last [time frame] that I could continue to develop to build on this achievement?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to reach my goals for the next [time frame]?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to reach the next stage at (Company)?
* What skills, knowledge, or behaviors do I need in order to realize my long term career aspirations?
* How might I leverage my strengths to achieve my goals?
* Of the opportunities identified, what are the 1-2 I want to set as goals to reach over this [time frame]? 
* What are the potential obstacles I have to overcome to reach my goals?
  * Are these obstacles a skill or knowledge deficit or are they something that is outside of your control?
* What would be the impact of reaching my goals on? The business and my career
* Remembering my strengths, what are the 1-2 next steps I will take to achieve my development goals?
 * For example, any L&D resources, or experts, you can take advantage of? Bonus points for writing as “if x happens, I will do y”. Commit to a date by when you will have accomplished this.

### Brag doc

I think it’s okay to make it quite long / comprehensive – 5-10 pages or more for a year of work doesn’t seem like too much to me, especially if you’re including some graphs/charts / screenshots to show the effects of what you did.

* Goals for this year and Goals for next year
* Projects: For each one, list contribution and impact. Impact may need to comeback and fill later
* Collaboration & mentorship
* Design & documentation: List design docs & documentation that you worked on
* Company building: “things you did to help the company overall, not just your project / team”
* What you learned: try listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently
