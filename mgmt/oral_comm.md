When time comes to reward people, it is the gut feeling of whose work is truly remarkable that matters. And what you usually convince yourself of is that the goal is important – but not that achieving it is remarkable. In fact, often someone pursuing what you think are unimportant goals in a way that you admire will impress you more than someone doing "important grunt work" (in your eyes.)

### reduce filler

We use these words as a verbal place holder when we are thinking — while communicating. They are a verbal representation of our thinking and an indication to our listener that we are not yet done communicating. They are a signal that what we are saying is getting ahead of what we are thinking.

Additionally, practicing your speech will definitively reduce your use of filler words. When we are prepared for any communications scenario we are more focused and effective in our deliver. 

A better habit than abuse/overuse of filler words is to allow yourself to pause. Doing so will allow you to think about what you will say next without filling the space with words that don’t serve your communication. Pause, then construct what you are going to say internally before you open your mouth.

A pause of silence allows us to think of what we’ll say next, stay centered and focused on the accuracy and effectiveness of our communication.

Speaking at a less hurried pace alongside these other techniques will help minimize your use of these meaningless words. 

Using filler words is a sign of nervousness and lack of preparation. Audiences are connected to confident speakers, and crutch words may detract from an otherwise excellent speech.

In order to start the process of elimination, you must become aware of your favorite filler words,” Smith says. “Personally, my go-to word was ‘so.’ Once I became aware of that, I realized my pattern of usage. Moving forward, during presentations I would mentally catch myself about to say 'so' and pause to avoid verbalizing it

Forcing yourself to notice other people’s less-than-eloquent speech patterns, too, can make you conscious of how often you slip “like” into daily conversations, say “um” before answering questions at cocktail parties, or lead sentences with an unnecessary “so” during work presentations.

If you’re a person who likes to write out what you plan to say, be sure to eliminate compound sentences, never start with a prepositional phrase, put most of your sentences in subject/predicate order and eliminate any vocabulary that you have difficulty saying without hesitating. The basic idea is to write for the ear, not the eye!

the optimum frequency is about one filler per minute, but the average speaker uses five fillers per minute — or, one every twelve seconds.

As long as the pause isn’t too long (no more than five seconds), the audience won’t hold it against you

 On average, the optimal ratio of preparation to performance is one hour of practice for every minute of presentation, but at the very least, recommends speakers get in at least three full runs before stepping in front of an audience.
