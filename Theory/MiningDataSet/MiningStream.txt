Two forms of query: ad hoc: normal queries asked one time about streams
Standing queries: queires that asked about stream at all times
-------
Counting bit problem

Summarize expoentially increasing blocks of the stream, looking backward
drop small blocks if they begin at the same point as a larger region or a larger region begins to their right
Error analysis, space analysis

Fixup: summarize blocks with specific numbers of 1s
A bucket is a segment of the window: timestamp of its end + # of 1s between its beggining and end 
# of 1s must be a power of 2 => space analysis
Update bucket:

Querying: why half teh size of oldest bucket
------
Bloom filter
Pr(false positivie): throwing darts argument => to e => calculate false positive
------
Unique search queries: why sampling doest work sometiems
Suppoer a query occurs exactly twice in teh stream, and we take 10% sample

Fix: sampling by stream rather than value

What if the total sample size is limited

Generallize to KV pair: sample based on picking soem set of keys onlyh, not pairs
----------
FM:pich h that maps n lements to at least log2n bits
r(a),h(a), R.
Pr(h(a) at least i 0s)
Pr(R >= i there are m elements) => approximate to e form
use taylor expansion on to m/2^i 
if 2^i>>m, 2^i << m, => 2^R is around m

But E(2^R) is infinite => workaround
partiion samples into small groups log n
take the average of groups,  then take the mediian of the averages

Suppose stream has elments chosen from a set of n values, mi: # of times value i occurs. kth moment is sum of (mi)k over all i
0th momennt = number of differnet elements in the stream
1st moment = # of elements
2nd moment = how uneven the distribution is (surprise number)

AMS method: based on calc of multiple random variables X
assume stream has lenght n. pick a random time to start, so that nay time is equally likely.
Let the chosen time have element a in the stream
X = n * ((2* num(a) in stream starting at the chosen time)-1)
proof: E(x) = 2nd moment

But stream has no size...
the variables X have n as a factor - keep n separately, just hold the count in X
Suppose we can only store k counts. We must throw some Xs out:
choose the first k times for k variables, when the nth element arrives, choose it with porbablility k/n
choose it with prob k/n(?), if you choose it, thorw one of the prviosuly stored variables out, with equal probablility
Pr(each of the first n-1 positions chosen)=
