In high dimension, all points look same distance

-----

how to represent cluster of points?
how to determin "nearness" of clusters?

possible meanings of "closest"

when to stop combining clusters?

-------
k-means
pick k, # of clusters
pick one point per cluster

for each point, place it int he cluster whose centriod is nearest
update the locations of cnetroids of the k clusters
reassign all points to their closest centroid

repeat until converge

how to pick k? look at distance to centroid as relation to k

pick initial k points
pick first at random, pick the next point to be the one whose min distance from the selected points is as large as possible
-----------
BFR: k-means for very large data, assume cluster is normally distributed around a centroid 

select the initial k centroids
discard set:
compression set:
retained set:

for each cluster: DS is summarized:
N, vector SUM, vector SUMSQ
=> can calc mean and variance with the 2 vectors

for each chunk of points
find points that are close to a cluster centroid, add tem to DS
remaining poins: cluster them and the old RS => clusters go to the CS, outlying to RS

merging compressed sets in the cs
if this is last round, merge all sets in the CS and all RSp oints into their nerares cluster

How do we decide to put a new point into a cluster?
Should 2 CS subclusters be combined?
