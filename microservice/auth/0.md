Very important to consider the logout scenario! 

separate authen and authorization filter

Refresh tokens are stored in DB and will have long expiration (example: 1 month).

Authorization header is not a simple header, hence a pre-flight request would be required for all the requests to a particular URLs.

But this happens if you are sending Content-Type: application/json for instance. So this is already happening for most applications.

One small caveat, the OPTIONS request won't have the Authorization header itself, so your web framework should support treating OPTIONS and the subsequent requests differently

-----------

Managing it at the microservice level is definitely a simpler and more straight forward approach. For us, the reason why we chose a central authorization is because we want to be able to create new permissions and map them to endpoints directly via a UI. This is especially important since we have different apps that might be accessing the same endpoints and different permissions will need access to those endpoints.

Authentication is more like fudge. There are at least a few ingredients that must brought together in the right way to make it work, and OAuth can be one of these ingredients (perhaps the main ingredient) but it doesn't have to be involved at all.

And in fact, there are a number of well-known recipes out there for doing this with specific providers, like Facebook Connect, Sign In With Twitter, and OpenID Connect (which powers Google's sign-in system, among others). These recipes each add a number of items, such as a common profile API, to OAuth to create an authentication protocol.

Google Cloud Endpoints handles both API keys and authentication schemes (such as Firebase or Auth0). The main distinction between these two is:

API keys identify the calling project — the app or site — making the call to an API

Auth tokens identify a user — the person — that is using the app or site

-------

Relying party applications, such as web applications, outsource the user authentication step to a trusted identity provider. Such a relying party application is said to be federated, that is, it consumes federated identity.

A federated identity in information technology is the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems

An identity provider is “a trusted provider that lets you use single sign-on (SSO) to access other websites.”
