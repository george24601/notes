td-agent is a stable distribution package of Fluentd.

td-agent prioritizes stability over new features

Fluent Bit is a Lightweight Data Forwarder for Fluentd. Fluent Bit is specifically designed for forwarding the data from the edge to Fluentd aggregators.

The /usr/lib/systemd/system/td-agent script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

If you want to customize systemd behaviour, put your td-agent.service into /etc/systemd/system

The configuration file consists of the following directives:

An event consists of three entities: tag, time and record. The tag is a string separated by ‘.’s (e.g. myapp.access), and is used as the directions for Fluentd’s internal routing engine. The time field is specified by input plugins, and it must be in the Unix time format. The record is a JSON object. 

“filter”: Event processing pipeline

Set system wide configuration: the “system” directive

Group filter and output: the “label” directive

@ERROR label is a built-in label used for error record emitted by plugin’s emit_error_event API.

If you set <label @ERROR> in the configuration, events are routed to this label when emit related error, e.g. buffer is full or invalid record.

Re-use your config: the “@include” directive
