examine datum by itself, to separate various parts of condiiton

may need to go back to definition to introduce new elements

may recombine elements of the problem which we use as an auxiliary problem
1: keep the unknown and change data and condition
2. keep the data and change unknown and condition
3. change both unknown and data

recall a familiar problem having similar unknown. If not, invent one: think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown

Can you solve a part of the problem?
common method: keep unknown and keep only part of the condition and do not introduce new clause or datum

the decisive idea often consists in carving out some more accesible but essential part from the problem

interesting way of changing unknown and data is interchanging the unknown with one of the data

after we drop condition to restrict less on unknown. How far is the unknown then determined, how can it vary?

start from a statment of problem with terms and arrived at a restatment free of those terms

We cannot know we need to use the notion or theorem about it. But we have to use one or the other. But which definition we use matters!

Dont let suspicous, guess, or conjecture grow without examination till it beocmes interadicable
