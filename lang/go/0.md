Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value. "" (the empty string) for strings.

Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order.


```go
func append(s []T, vs ...T) []T
```

In general, all methods on a given type should have either value or pointer receivers, but not a mixture of both

A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.

Empty interfaces are used by code that handles values of unknown type. For example, fmt.Print takes any number of arguments of type `interface{}.`

Under the hood, interface values can be thought of as a tuple of a value and a concrete type:

(value, type)
An interface value holds a value of a specific underlying concrete type.

Calling a method on an interface value executes the method of the same name on its underlying type.
