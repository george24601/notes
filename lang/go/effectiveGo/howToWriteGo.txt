Go programmers typically keep all their Go code in a single workspace.
A workspace contains many version control repositories (managed by Git, for example).

A workspace is a directory hierarchy with three directories at its root:

src contains Go source files,
pkg contains package objects, and
bin contains executable commands.

The tree above shows a workspace containing two repositories (example and image). The example repository contains two commands (hello and outyet) and one library (stringutil). The image repository contains the bmp package and several others.

You write a test by creating a file with a name ending in _test.go that contains functions named TestXXX with signature func (t *testing.T). The test framework runs each such function; if the function calls a failure function such as t.Error or t.Fail, the test is considered to have failed.

The imports in hello.go file use the same import path convention, so the go get command is able to locate and install the dependent package, too.
