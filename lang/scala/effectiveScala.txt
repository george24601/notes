Nested functions:
compare with various let operators in ML

currying
What is the type of curried/parital applied function

lambda and higher-order functions

invariance, covariance, and contravariance
Immutable collections should be covariant. Mutable collections should be invariant. 
When using collections, qualify names by importing scala.collection.immutable and/or scala.collection.mutable
If your method needs a sequence, use Seq[T], not List[T]. 


You don’t even have to use the new keyword to create a new instance of a case class. 

val evenNumbers =
 for {
  number <- numbers
  if number % 2 == 0
 } yield number


Use return type annotaion for public methods

-----
type aliases

class ConcurrentPool[K, V] {
  type Queue = ConcurrentLinkedQueue[V]
  type Map   = ConcurrentHashMap[K, Queue]
  ...
}

-----
Cases to use implicit

Extending or adding a Scala-style collection

Adapting or extending an object (“pimp my library” pattern)

Use to enhance type safety by providing constraint evidence
To provide type evidence (typeclassing)

For Manifests

----
future

Do not throw your own exceptions in methods that return Futures. Futures represent both successful and failed computations. Therefore, it’s
important that errors involved in that computation are properly encapsulated in the returned Future. Concretely, return Future.exception
instead of throwing that exception:

def divide(x: Int, y: Int): Future[Result] = {
  if (y == 0)
    return Future.exception(new IllegalArgumentException("Divisor is 0"))

  Future.value(x/y)
}

----
return inside closure is implemented as catch/throwing pair - performance implication

----
assert: invariants that the code assumes
require: API contracts 

Declaring the type sealed allows the compiler to do exhaustivity analysis since constructors cannot be added outside the source file.

opt foreach { value =>
  operate(value)
}

operate(opt getOrElse defaultValue)
----
partial functions

val pf: PartialFunction[Int, String] = {
  case i if i%2 == 0 => "even"
}
and they may be composed with orElse

val tf: (Int => String) = pf orElse { case _ => "odd"}

or in situations that might otherwise call for returning an Option:

----
Destruction binding

val tweet = Tweet("just tweeting", Time.now)
val Tweet(text, timestamp) = tweet

-----
A class member marked private,

private val x: Int = ...
is visible to all instances of that class (but not their subclasses). In most cases, you want private[this].

private[this] val x: Int = 

----
case classes: preferred way to define complex data
e.g.

abstract class JSON
case class JSeq(elems: List[JSON]) extends JSON
case class JObj (bindings: Map[String, JSON]) extends JSON
case class JStr(num: String) extends JSON
case object JNull extends JSON


-------
e1.map(x=>e2)
for  (x <- e1) yield e2

for(x<-e1 if f; s) yield e2
for (x<- e1.withfilter(x=>f); s) yield e2

for(x<-e1; y<-e2; s) yield e3
e1.flatMap(x => for (y<-e2; s) yield e3)

x<- expr withFilter {
	case pat => true
	case _ => false
} map {
 case pat => x
}
