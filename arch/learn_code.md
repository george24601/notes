As a final step to learning internals, I read recent commits relevant to the subsystems I’ve studied and test that I fully understand why the change was made. This is my “doing the problem set in the back of the textbook” portion of learning.

I either view the commit history of the project or the commit history of a specific file or folder relevant to a subsystem I’ve studied. I then either study the solution first (the changes in the commit) or I see the bug it fixed and attempt to fix it myself and see if I arrive to a similar solution.

To “work the problem”, I’ll checkout the repository at the commit just previous to the commit I’m studying. I’ll reproduce the bug it fixes (if it is a bug fix), and then attempt to implement the solution myself. Finally, I’ll compare my work to the commit done by the maintainer or contributor.
