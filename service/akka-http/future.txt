make sure to instanctice all independent futures before the for compression, to allow them to run in parallel

for blocking IO, probably create an ExecutionContext in scope, in the DB layer

vital to NOT change state inside future (violats error kernel pattern), thus, we need to keep track of sender, and then repipe back to self,
and handle it purely within actor

similarly, sender has to be copied before entering future, because it will change!

-------
use future.recover to gracefully translate error returned from child

val purchase: Future[Int] = rateQuote map {
  quote => connection.buy(amount, quote)
} recover {
  case QuoteChangedException() => 0
}

The recover combinator creates a new future which holds the same result as the original future if it completed successfully. If it did not
then the partial function argument is applied to the Throwable which failed the original future. If it maps the Throwable to some value,
then the new future is successfully completed with that value. If the partial function is not defined on that Throwable, then the resulting
future is failed with the same Throwable.

--------

Note that recovery strategy applies to parent-child relationship, but for collaborators, need to use deathwatch=>Terminated(deadActor)

-------
Another example: note the concurrent future and if filtering, also, filter is same as withFilter

also, collect anf filter relationship
foreach is same as onSuccess

val usdQuote = Future { connection.getCurrentValue(USD) }
val chfQuote = Future { connection.getCurrentValue(CHF) }
val purchase = for {
  usd <- usdQuote
  chf <- chfQuote
  if isProfitable(usd, chf)
} yield connection.buy(amount, chf)
purchase onSuccess {
  case _ => println("Purchased " + amount + " CHF")
}

recoverWith to recover, similar to flatMap to map

----------
Notice how fallbackTo is used

val usdQuote = Future {
  connection.getCurrentValue(USD)
} map {
  usd => "Value: " + usd + "$"
}
val chfQuote = Future {
  connection.getCurrentValue(CHF)
} map {
  chf => "Value: " + chf + "CHF"
}
val anyQuote = usdQuote fallbackTo chfQuote
anyQuote onSuccess { println(_) }

-------
andThen: side effects 
returns a new future with exactly same result as the current future

val allposts = mutable.Set[String]()
Future {
  session.getRecentPosts
} andThen {
  posts => allposts ++= posts
} andThen {
  posts =>
  clearAll()
  for (post <- allposts) render(post)
}
