In FP, we break programs down into functions that perform some ops
In OOP, we break programs down into classes that give behavior to some kind of data => need double dispatch to deal with ops with multiple arguments

Example:
Expression for language such as for arithmetic
variatns of expressions: int, neg, add
operations over expressions: eval them, convert to strings, hasZero

FP approach
datatype for expressions, with one ctor for each variant
define function for each operation
in each function, have a branch for each variant of data => may use wildcard pattern to avoid enumberation all the branches

i.e., procedural decomposition => each procedure corresponds to each operation

OOP
define a class for expressions
subclass for each variant of data
in each subclass, have a mehtod def for each ops => use super class to implement default behaviour

If we add a new op
FP approach: 
add a new function
add a new data type
all functions with a new case

Exactly opposite with FP approach

-------
visitor pattern in OOP to support new operations (often with double dispatch)
IN FP, can find datatypes to have an "other" posibility and opertions to take in a function that can process the "other data"

Note you can not wrap the original datatype in a newdatatype to support new data type => so your ADD can not have Mult

In fact, languages often provide contructs exactly to prevent extensibility: ML moduels can hide datatpes, Java's final prevents subclasses

----

interface:
An interface is a type, can solve some problems with multiple inheritance
fundamental to type checking, which is why they dont exist in ruby

```ruby
module Color
	attr_acceotr:color
	def darken
		self.color = "dart" + self.color
	end
end

class ColorPt < Pt
	include Color
end
```

often, mixins call other methods on self that are not defined by the mixin. Instead, the mixin assumes that all clases that include the mixin define this method

interface: purely for type checking purposes. Therefore, no need for dynamically-typed languages to have interface. Similarly there is no need to have abstract method

Type system flexibility
ML: parametric polymorphism/generics
C#: subtype polymorphism/subtyping

---
Simple type system rules

1. if e1 has type t1, e2 has t2, then {f1 = e1, f2 = e2} has type {f1:t1, f2:t2}
2. If e has a record type containing f: t, then e.f has type t
3. if e1 has a record  f: t and e2 has type t, then e1.f = e2 has type t

=> relax type rule a bit

if some exp has a record type, then let the expression also have a type where some of the fields are removed => letting an expression that has one type also hae another type that has less information is the idea of subtyping

=> 4. If e has type t1 and t1 <: t2 then e has type t2

if our goal is to prevent field-missing erors, then we cannot add any subtyping rules that would cause us to stop meeting our goal 
=> "subtyping is not a matter of opinion"
=> width subtyping: A subtype can have a subset of fields with the same type,i.e., a subtype can have "extra" fileds
=> permutation subtyping: A supertype can have the same set of fields with the same types in a different order
=> if t1 <: t2, and t2 <: t3, then t1 <: t3
=> Every type is a subtype of itself

--------
so "depth checking"

e.g. passing a sphere into a circle function => will not type check, because the type is {{x, y, z}, r} instead of {{x, y}, r}

if ta <: tb then {f1:t1,....,f:ta,...fn:tn} <: {f1:t1,....,f:tb,...,fn:tn}

problem: the member will be mutated into a supertype!!=> so if the field is not settable (immutable) depth subtyping rule is sound

------

Java's array allows depth subcheckng, and will raise runtime excpetion if the subtype array is assigned a supertype

Java and c# allow null to have any object type, so every field access and method call includes a run-time check for null => NullPonterException => proposals to never hold null support, e.g., Option types in ML

---
a subtype can have extra fields
because fields are mutable, a subtype cannot have a different type for a field
a subytpe can have extra methods
because methods are immutable, a subtype can have a subtype for a method, which means the method in the subtype can have contravariant argument types and a covaraint result type
=> a subclass can override a method a with a covaraint return type

class and types are different! => class defines an object's behavior, a type describes what fields an object has and what messages it can respond to. Subtyping is a question of substitutability and what we want to flag as a type error

-----------

Subtyping is a bad substitute for Generics
in general, when you use Object and downcasts, you are essentially taking a dynamic typing approach

key of generic => mark mutliple uses of that is of same type

Generics are a bad substitute for subtyping
---
bounded generic types:
instead of just saying "a subtype of T" or "for all types 'a" => for all types 'a that are a subtype of T =>

static <T extends Pt> List<T> inCircle(List<T> pts, Pt center, double radius)
{
}
