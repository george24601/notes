uninterpreted base types: no ops for introducing/eliminating terms => treat them as type variables

type substitution: mapping sigma from type variable to type
apply the mapping to a type T to obtain sigma(T)

variable capture possible?

type substition is extended pointwise to the context

if sigma is type substitution and gamma |-t :T, then sigma(gamma) |- sigma(t): sigma(T)

parametric polymorphism: for every sigma, is sigma(gamma) |- sigma(t): T for some T, ie., all sustitution instances well typed?

type reconstruction/type inference write the syntax in the untyped lambda calculus
