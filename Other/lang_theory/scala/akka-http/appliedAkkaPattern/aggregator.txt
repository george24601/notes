Init an aggregator actor with collection of actors to ask. It'll be responsible for gathering responses for a particular request.
Propagate request to all actors through an aggregator.
When a reply arrives, remove the sender from the list of actors remaining to answer.
Apply receive timeout for safety (so we don't wait for response infinitely).
Once all actors have responded or timeout occurred, send aggregated replies back to the original sender and stop aggregator actor.
