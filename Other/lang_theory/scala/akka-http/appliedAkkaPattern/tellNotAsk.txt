Create future, either with the Future{} block or Promises

Promise is one to conform the "tell, don't ask pattern" 

ask timeouts are hard to debug, and can hide the asked actor's failure

However, ask is useful for talking to external system, i.e., request/response, or
when # of potentially participating actors may vary depending on msg parameters and can not be cached, and it is ahrd to set stop condition
for aggregator pattern
