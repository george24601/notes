recipient list is often sort of dynamic router => calcualte recipient list based on set of rules
For the process actor, upon receiving a message, it checks the business rules of every registered interest, and then forward the message to
the corresponding , interested quote engine

Use the aggregator to gather result, the idea is that from requstor perspective, it deals only with the main processor
1. create an aggregator, pass into the scatter/recipient list /processor

2. upon receiving a quote from the intereested worker, processor forward the message to the aggregator

3. upen receiving a request to calculate, processor send the list of correlate message id (and probably size) to the  aggregator

4. the aggregator receives 2 types of messages, 1 to init the list, one is the actual result

5. in the example, one aggregator handles all different requests, that also means deregister fulfilled tasks

6. Upon completion, the aggregator sends back to the worker, and it will act as interface to the requesting actor and thus reply
