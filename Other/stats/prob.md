The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacementtext annotation indicator, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.

This will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skewed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually n > 30). If the population is normal, then the theorem holds true even for samples smaller than 30.

The law of iterated logarithms operates “in between” the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

#Suppose that a test for using a particular drug is 99% sensitive and 99% specific. That is, the test will produce 99% true positive results for drug users and 99% true negative results for non-drug users. Suppose that 0.5% of people are users of the drug. What is the probability that a randomly selected individual with a positive test is a drug user?

P(drug | positive) = P(positive | drug) * P(drug) / P(positive) = 0.99 * 0.995/ (P(positive | drug) * P(drug) + P(positvie | no-drug) * P(no-drug))

#The entire output of a factory is produced on three machines. The three machines account for 20%, 30%, and 50% of the factory output. The fraction of defective items produced is 5% for the first machine; 3% for the second machine; and 1% for the third machine. If an item is chosen at random from the total output and is found to be defective, what is the probability that it was produced by the third machine?

P(third | def) = P(def | third) * P(third) /P(def) = 0.01 * 0.5 / 0.2 * 0.05 + 0.3 * 0.03 + 0.5 * 0.01
