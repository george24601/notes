low-latency, approximate, and speculative results => not really for streaming

strong consistency is required for exactly once processing

checkout millwheel and spark streaming papers

windowing by event time alone is not enough, why? => notion of completeness being optimization rather than necessary

How does batch system handle unbounded data? what are the potential problems?

for distributed input sources, data are highly unordered w.r.t. event time, and can not assume you see the complete/most of data given an
epsilon

what is the problem with outer join?

approximation top-N, streaming K-means...what are potential problems with them?

sessions-unaligned windows

when would you use a processing time window? when would you not?

problems with event time windowing? what are solutions/workarounds?

To handle completeness problem
1. accurate heuristic estimate
2. pipeline builder speicfiies when to materialize, and how to refine data over time => use trigger
----------
accumulation: relationship between multiple results for the same window. refinement of results: discarding/accumulating/accumulating and
retracting

watermark: mapping from processing time to event time

can not get low latency and correctness out of a system based purely on completeness

trigger: GC if window outlives/processing time progress/element counts/punctuation/data-dependent
Repitiion, AND, OR, sequence of child triggers

How do they handle too slow/too fast cases with trigger?
repeated-early | on-time | repeated-late => they normalize perfect and heuristic WM output patterns

Any real-world, out-of-order system need to bound the lifetime of windows => horizon: how late a data can be, untill watermark exceeds
horizon of that window

when would you use discarding accumulation?
when would you use accumulation and retraction? regroup by a different key, sessionizatioan/dynamics

----
possible to tag session data with a common ID => becomes group by key

insight for session: merge single event windows

walk throught the session example!
