pure oo => every exp evaluates to an object

every object is an instance of a class

mixins => compromise between multiple inheritance and interfaces

dynamically typed, allow instance variables and methods to be added and
removed from objects while a program executes

reflection: every object has class and methods objects
------
class Foo
	def m1
	..
end

def m2 (x,7)
....

class names must be capitalized

If a method argument has a defualt, then all arguments to its right must also
have a default

def myMethod(x,y, z=0, w="hi")
...
end

call itself => self.m

All instance variables start with an @, @@ => class variables

Create instance => Foo.new(,...)

class constant: starts with a capital letter instead of @@. Should not mutate
it. Publicly visible. To access, use :: ,e.g., Math::PI

class method:

def self.method_name args
..
end

getter and setter => methods are public by default:

def foo
 @foo
end

def foo= x
@foo =x
end

conditials treats everything but false and nil as true

nil? method

Often convenicent for methods to return self so that subsequent method calls
can be put together

duck-typing:
def mirror_update pt
	pt.x = pt.x * -1
end

=> normally in place unless you use instance_of? or is_a?
-----

Array.new(x) creates an array of length x with each index initially mapped to
nil

Array.new(5) {|i| -i} =>

can hold obje ts that are instances of different classes

negative array indices

no array-bound errors => nil for getter, grow array for setter

+ and | operator

push, pop, shift, unshift
---------

int.times {puts "hi"}

y = 7 
[4,6,8].each {y += 1}

sum = 0
[4,6,8].each {|x| 
sum += x
puts sum
}

But blocks are not objects. can NOT pass them as arguments to a method.
Rather, any method can be passed either 0 or 1 blocks, sepearte from the other
arguments.

inject is like fold
sum = [4,6,8].inject(0) {|acc, elt| acc + elt}

map, select (filter in ML), any?, all?

-------
using blocks => yield keyword. e.g, prints "hi" 3 times

def foo x
	if x
		yield
	else
		yield
		yield
foo true {puts "hi"}
foo false{puts "hi"}

pass arguments to a block => yield (8, "str")

a recursive method passing block

def coutn i
	if yield i
	1
	else
	1 + (count (i+ 1) { |x| yield x})
	end
end
------
Blocks are NOT closures because they are not objects => they are not
"first-class values", which is something that can be stored and passed like
anything else in the language

Suppose we want to create an array of blocks => cant because array holds
objects are blocks are not objects, but we can use lambda to careate an array
of instances of Proc

c = a.map {|x| lambda {|y| x >= y}}

c[2].call 17
j = c.count {|x| x.call(5)}
-------

Hashes

{"SML" => 7, "Racket" =>12, "Ruby" => 42}

keys, values, delete, each, inject

Range (2...10) => because of duck typing, most methods using array can accept
range as well.

---
class C < D ...end

reflection => superclass method
is_a? instance_of? => in conflict with duck typing

-----

class Point
attr_accessor :x, :y

def initialize(x,y)
	@x = x
	@y = y
end

def distFromOrigin
	Math.sqrt(@x * @x + @y * @y)
end

def distFromOrigin2
	Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)//uses getter method
end

end

class ColorPoint < Point
attr_accessor :color

def initialize(x,y,c="clear")
	super(x,y) //not required but often desired
	@color = c
end

end
-----
Dynamic dispatch explained

support we have call e0.m(e1,....,en)

1.Evaluate e0,e1,...en to values obj0, obj1,...,objn
2.Get the calss of obj0 (think of the class as part of the state of obj0)
3.Suppose obj0 has class A, if m is defined in A, call that method. Otherwise, call the super classes recursivly
4.bind self to obj0 (different from FP), obj1...objn to x1....xn

Step 4 is what called "late-binding", "dynamic dispatch", "virtual method call"


------
Dynamic dispatch vs Closures

Example: two ML functions
=> this creates two closures that both have the other closure in their environment => lexical scoping => subclass and dynamic dispatch would violate it

Overriding and dynamic dispatch is the biggest thing that distinguishes oop
from functional programming
