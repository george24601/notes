function body is evaluated in teh enviromnet where the function waqs defiened-> extended with the function arugment

but the environment may involve nested let-expressions not just the top-level sequence of bidnings

why lexical scope:
1.can change body of f to use q everywher instead of x
lexical scope: doesnt matter
dynamic scope: depsnds how result is used
2. functions can be type-checed and reson about where defiend
3.closures can easily steor the data they need

Function body is not evaled until it is called
it is evaled eveyr time it is called
a variable ding evaluts isexpression when the ding is evaluated, not every time the variable is used
e.g. one coputes string.size once per element of xs
closer can avoid repeating computations that do not depend o function arguments
another one computes string.sze once per list with list

use of closure
pass functoins with private data to iterators
combine functoins
currying callbaks...

currying:
syntactic suger
fun f p1 p2 p3 = e is fun f p1 = fn  p2 => fn p3 =>....-> e

parital applicatiopn: we dont supply all curries argument..it returns a function!
espcially nice for iterator-like functions=> one reason why lib functoins of this form usually curred

but if use partial palicaiton to create a polyumorphic funciton, it may not work due to the value restirction!

dont program against an implemenatiaon until it mateters
