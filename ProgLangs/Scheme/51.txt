the expressions are all evaluted in the enviroment from BEFORE THE LET-EXPRESSION

let*: same as ML's let

letret: the expression are evaluted in the envomer that inclues ALL THE BIDNINGS
needed for mutal recursion, but expresss are still evualted in order-> out of order will give #undeifned

(lambda (z) (_ z y w x))

(define (sillu-mode 2x)
	(if (even? x) 0 1))

top-level define: can be forward ref as long as when it is called all needed parts ar evaled

(set! x e) assignment statemnet

if soemthng you need not to change might change, kae a local copy of it

so you can set! even system functions!

cons just e makes a pair

list: recursive cons ends with a nil
(define lst (cons 1 (cons #t (cons "hi" nll)))) ;just create a list
(length pr)

list? 
pair?

mcons:cells are mutabls

functiaon args: eval eagerly

cond: not much

example: my if bad=>  never ending recursion because both are evaled regardless

(if e1 e2 e3)) vs(if e1 (r2) (e3))

(e2) calls a zero arg functions: so that function body is not evaled until it is hit!-common techini

a zero arg lambda used to delay evalution: thunk

problem: thunk will be evaled every time its re-called, e.g. recursive case!
if in the expression, it is evaled already=> net loss
best of both worlds: lazy evalutaion->thunks and mutable pairs are enough to build


(define (my-dealy th)
	(mcons #f th))

(define (my-force p)
(if (mcar p)
	(mcdr p)
	(begin (set-mcar! p #2)
		(set-mcdr! p ((mcdr p)))
		(mcdr p))))

(f (my-delay( lambda() e))))=> passed


(my-mult x (let ([x (my-delay (lambda*( (slow-add 3 4)))[) (labmda() (my-force p))))

steram:   an infiite sequence of values

use a thunk to delya creating most of the sequence=> cannot make a stream by making all the values

stream producer knows how creat nay number of values

stream consumer decides how many values to ask for

let a stream be a thunk that when called returns a pair

(car (powers-of-tow))
(cdr (powers-of-tow))

(define (number-until stream tester)
	(letrec ([f (lambda (stream ans)
(let ([]r (stream)])
	(if (tester (car pr))
		ans
	(f (cdr pr) (+ ans 1)))])

(number-until powers-of-tow (lambda (x) (=x 16)))

(define ones (lamdbda() (cons 1 ones)))

(define (f x) (cons x (lambda () (f (+ x 1))))

(define nats
	(letrec([f (lambda (x) (cons x(lambda () (f (+ x 1)))
		(lambdasa (f 1)))


	(f stream 1)
