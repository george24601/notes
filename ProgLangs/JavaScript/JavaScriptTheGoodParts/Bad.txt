global variable: 3 ways to declare
place var outside any function
use a varaible without declaring it!!

lack of block scope => forces you to declare all varibles at the top of
function

semicolom insertion => put bracket same line as return. Otherwise, SI will
return an undefined

typof null is 'object' => my_value === null for nullity test

parseInt()

+: make sure if both operands are numbers or not

JS's floating point's inherent precision problem

NaN: not a number, BUT type NaN === 'number', NaN === NaN //false
Use isNaN instead
better
var isNumber = function isNumber(value) {return typeof value === 'number' &&
isFinite(value);}

Phoney array

Falsy values
-------
Always use === and !==

continue

eval

switch Fall Through
Worst features: features that are both useful and dangerous

Block-less Statement

++--

Avoid new Object and new Array. Use {} and [] instead

----
new
Creates a new object that inherits from the operand's prototype member, and
then calls the operand, binding the new object to this.

if you forget new, you get a function call, and this is bound to the global
object instead of the new one

Dont use new at all
----

Avoid void

Use of JSLint
